Three of the five suspects arrested over the kidnapping and murder of Jabulani Mukhabela, 28, and Carlos Novela, 30, appeared in the Lenasia Magistrate’s Court on Monday. The three accused, Naveen Kali, Lerato Euphrasia Motsopa and Shakeel Sahabadien were charged with murder, kidnapping and defeating the ends of justice. The accused are security guards linked to a filling station near Soweto where the victims were allegedly caught stealing. It is alleged that Mukhabela and Novela were caught at a nearby school after they stole from the filling station. They were allegedly arrested and taken away by security guards hired by the filling station.The victims were apprehended and never seen again for nine days before their bodies were found dumped. They made their first appearance in court with private lawyers to represent them, much to the Mukhabela family’s dismay. After a long wait outside the court, with EFF protesters singing in support, the family were called in for the hearing. There was a discussion between the defence and prosecution regarding whether they were opposing bail as it was not stipulated on State documents. Magistrate Maggie van der Merwe then asked the prosecution to find out and state whether or not they were opposing bail as the presiding prosecutor was not in. The court was then adjourned to allow the prosecutor standing in to get the information. The State came back to confirm they were opposing bail and the hearing was postponed to Tuesday to allow for the residing prosecutor to return. The Star
