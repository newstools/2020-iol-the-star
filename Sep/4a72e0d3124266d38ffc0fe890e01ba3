Loud applause erupted in Protea Magistrate’s Court when magistrate David Mhango denied bail to three police officers accused of shooting dead Nathaniel Julies. The three are Sergeant Simon "Scorpion" Ndyalvane, constable Caylene Whiteboy and sergeant Foster Netshiongolo. They are accused of killing Julies, 16, who had Down syndrome, near his Eldorado Park home last month. Mhango dismissed the defence’s argument as weak and said if the trio were released on bail, there was a likelihood that they would interfere with the case and threaten State witnesses. Nathaniel’s mother, Bridgette Harri, welcomed the court's decision with visible relief. “I am very happy that the magistrate considered the community and that he denied them bail. For me it's still a long way to go. A lot of things are still going to come out and I can say now that I am happy,” said Harris. She said: “I witnessed a brutal murder case and that's my son that's caught in this whole thing, we must get justice.” Nathaniel’s grandfather, Frank James Julies, said he never thought he would be in a courtroom listening to the proceedings of his grandson's murder. However, he is consoled by the court's verdict. “It’s consolation to see that there is still fairness in the justice system,” said Julies. In reaching his verdict, the magistrate said the trio would remain in custody and Whiteboy, 23, would be put in a safe prison for her own safety as she alleged that co-accused Ndyalvane had sent her threatening WhatsApp messages. The matter was postponed to November 6 for further investigations. The Star
