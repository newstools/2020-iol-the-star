By Harry Sewlall On Heritage Day I noticed that the liquor store at my Pick n Pay was closed. I thought it was a most welcome move on the part of the government and these stores. As a responsible drinker for most of my 71 years, and who progressed from a junior primary teacher to a university professor, notwithstanding my indulgence, I would like to express my views on the state of alcohol consumption. During the earlier lockdowns, I lobbied for, and argued against the myopic and somewhat vindictive decision of the National Coronavirus Command Council to prohibit the sale of liquor, given that my friends overseas were enjoying their tipple in the privacy of their homes. Under lockdown level 1, I note with consternation that the government has swung to the other end of the pendulum and has almost allowed bars, liquor stores and taverns carte blanche to operate. If we are serious about the abuse of alcohol and its attendant social ills â€¦ then I would urge government to reintroduce the strict conditions that prevailed under lockdown level 3. In addition to other measures, the government might contemplate discouraging the consumption of alcohol, especially among the young, I suggest that going forward, post-Covid-19, the sale of alcohol must be banned on public holidays and weekends, starting on a Friday. That means that taverns should also be closed. If we are serious about curbing alcohol abuse, the restricted sale of liquor will force South Africans to take responsibility for the times they can purchase alcohol and consume it. The Star
