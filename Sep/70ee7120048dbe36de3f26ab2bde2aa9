By Harry Sewlall I could not believe that Dr Ellapen Rapiti was advocating for Herman Mashaba and his ragtag band in the next general election (ActionSA just the party needed to save SA, The Star letters page, September 1). Dr Rapiti refers to Vytjie Mentor et al. as people who have “made their mark on the lives of South Africans”. Isn’t this the same Vytjie who was once hobnobbing with Jacob Zuma? But more importantly, didn’t she sound delusional when giving evidence at the Zondo Commission? Now I come to Mashaba. I have never heard him respond directly to a question posed by the media. He is an “I” (Eye) specialist, always evading the question and referring to what he did when he took over blah blah blah from the ANC-led Joburg metro. His resignation as mayor was an act of grandstanding, coming conveniently at a time when the finances of the city were in a shambles. During his tenure as mayor he hiked property values by as much as 200%. He brought in the services of some business partners to arrive at the ludicrously high property values. He has left many pensioners like me (aged 71) close to destitution because the setting up of an Appeals Board was a farce. Two years down the line, no one in that department picks up the phone. Dr Rapiti, please do not lead Mashaba and his political renegades up the garden path. Harry Sewlall is a reader from Sandton, Johannesburg. The Star
