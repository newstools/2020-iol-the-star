By John Whitlock I fully realise that the Caster Semenya issue is a very sensitive and delicate matter for a number of South Africans. However, I have a few remarks that I would like to make. There is no doubt that she has a distinct advantage over other “normal” female athletes. This is a proven fact, otherwise there would not be all the fuss, as well as the ruling by the Swiss Federal Court. Second, there seems to be very little, if any, support for Caster from other transgender athletes and/ or sporting bodies. Are they really interested in Caster’s complaints? Third, South Africa no has longer the clout and influence it had 20 years ago when we were the talk of the town. Our reputation has, unfortunately, been tarnished over the years by a number of factors known to all. Fourth, wouldn’t it solve the problem if there was a specific race category/event for only transgender athletes to compete against each other? That would level the playing field, and would be very interesting. Then, last, on the other side of the coin, could the “normal” athletes not take testosterone-enhancing drugs to up their testosterone levels to that of Caster’s, and so compete on an equal basis – that is, if she refuses to take a drug to lower her levels? I’m quite sure that if Caster was to take part in the 200m that she would win it quite easily as, once again – she has the distinct advantage of higher testosterone levels than her fellow athletes. So it would not be a major feat, or earth-shattering result. It would be expected. I doubt whether her continual fight against the ruling will ever bear fruit and be changed in any way. The Star
