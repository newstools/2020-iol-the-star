By Collin Berrington It seems the independence of the judiciary, a necessary element of democracy, and its integrity are at risk from our so-called politicians. This has once again been highlighted by the Andile Lungisa case (an ANC councillor jailed for hitting a DA councillor over the head with a glass water jug). The case seems to have been a slam-dunk grievous bodily harm assault, with video evidence. Lungisa says the video should have been challenged during the trial, which dragged on for four years, because the video evidence had been tampered with. Surely no one would do such a terrible thing to such a nice man? Sorry, I forgot that he hit someone over the head with a glass jug, possibly not such a nice guy. The kindly Julius Malema is supportive of Lungisa, saying: “Andile Lungisa did nothing wrong, and I support him”. This is the same Malema who faces charges of assaulting a policeman. With any luck, assuming that the court refuses further remands and delays, Malema may be able to offer support to his fellow prisoner Lungisa in person. The real issue here is that of our elected leaders who seek to undermine the judiciary. This is also a major cause of the scourge of violence that scars our country – politicians who assault others and believe they are blameless. The violence, gender-based or otherwise, is rooted in our political structures and not, as the ANC tries to claim, as a result of alcohol abuse. Judges should not permit the endless postponements of cut-and-dried assault cases. Malema’s case has been postponed until October. Please, no more of this nonsense characteristic of #freelungisa campaigns or the mindless rationalisation offered by Malema. Violent assaults need to be punished. The Star
