Johannesburg - The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) has arrested a third police officer in connection with the death of Nathaniel Julies. Ipid spokesperson Ndileka Cola said the third officer was arrested on Tuesdsy afternoon and was charged with defeating the ends of justice and being in possession of prohibited ammunition. The third suspect is a detective from the Eldorado Park police station, she said. “He is set to appear before the Protea Magistrate’s Court on Thursday (tomorrow),” said Cola. Cola said that Ipid was still investigating the matter. The other two officers, Sergeant Simon Ndyalvane and Constable Caylene Whiteboy, appeared in the Protea Magistrate’s Court on Monday. Ndyalvane and Whiteboy have been remanded in custody until September 10 and they face charges of murder, discharging of a firearm in a public place, being in possession of prohibited ammunition and defeating the ends of justice. Nathaniel was shot and killed last Wednesday night in Eldorado Park. The shooting death sparked angry protests in the area, with calls for the leadership of the local police station to be removed. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane said the officers faced a Schedule 6 offence and that the NPA will oppose bail when they make their second court appearance on September 10. “The State alleges that the police officers used ammunition that is prohibited by the law and that they attempted to discard evidence.” Nathaniel, who suffered from Down syndrome, was gunned down last Wednesday and died later in hospital.
