By Kevin Govender Saturday, September 5 was the International Day of Charity (IDOC) and this date was chosen to commemorate the death of Mother Teresa of Calcutta, who passed away on this date in 1997. She was a frail and dainty servant of the people of India, who was quoted often as saying: “Don’t look for the big things, just do the small things with great love.” The primary purpose of the international proclamation of the IDOC is to create awareness and provide a common platform for charity-related activities across the world for individuals, charitable, philanthropic and volunteer organisations for their own purposes at local, regional, national or international levels.
