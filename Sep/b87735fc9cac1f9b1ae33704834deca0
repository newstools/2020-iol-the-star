By Thabile Mange Kagiso, which means peace in Setswana, was established in 1920. The area was born out of migrants who had come to work in Krugersdorp and found refuge in Munsieville, the oldest township in Mogale City, Luipaardsvlei and surrounding areas. Due to overpopulation, the then-regime moved black people to a new area called Kagiso. The township is 100 years old. But there is no hype about it. There are no planned celebrations. Are residents not aware that Kagiso turns 100 this year? Or is it not a big deal for them? There are no easy answers. Our children don’t know the origins and history of Kagiso. They also don’t know our Struggle heroes and heroines. The 100-year celebrations would have afforded us the opportunity to educate our impressionable children about our township. Kagiso is the most famous, popular and vibrant township on the West Rand. The area has produced many shining stars who have put the West Rand on the map. For instance, Nomvula Mokonyane, who originates from Kagiso, was the first female premier in Gauteng. Add to that the soccer stars of the yesteryears such as Toyota “Toy” Ramusa who played for Orlando Pirates, and Kenneth “The Horse” Mokgojoa who played for Kaizer Chiefs and plied his trade overseas. Mokgojoa was also the Bafana Bafana assistant coach. Need I say more? The 100th celebration of Kagiso would have been a powerful marketing tool for the township. Residents would have worn T-shirts and caps printed with “Kagiso is 100 years old”. The media would have written stories about the area and its history. This is a missed opportunity. History will judge us harshly.
