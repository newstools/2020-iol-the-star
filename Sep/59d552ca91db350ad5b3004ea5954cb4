More than 60 people were arrested for stealing, vandalising and breaking into schools last year. According to answers given in the Gauteng provincial legislature by Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko, more than 721 cases of theft, burglary and vandalism were opened last year. Of the reported cases, 17 people were arrested for theft, 45 for burglary and five for vandalism. Last year, Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said the damage  cost more than R120 million after 256 schools were broken into, vandalised or items stolen from them. DA education spokesperson Khume Ramulifho said more needed to be done to deter criminals from targeting schools. “It is very worrying that there is a low arrest rate despite the high number of cases reported. The fact that there is a low arrest rate clearly indicates an ineffective school safety strategy and that the SAPS are failing to prioritise schools as there is no investigation progress report for the cases opened. “It is concerning that the department continues to lose millions in theft and burglaries while not much is being done to safeguard assets,” Ramulifho said. This year, the department is expected to spend even more in fixing schools. From the beginning of the lockdown, more than 1 500 schools were hit. In Gauteng, about 336 were targeted. In July, Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga said criminals were wreaking havoc in schools by burning and vandalising them. She said her department had to repair  1 718 schools countrywide that had been vandalised during the lockdown. The Star
