The bail  application of the three police officers accused of killing Nathaniel Julies stunningly revealed the identity of the cop who fired the fatal bullet. The court heard that 23-year-old constable Caylene Whiteboy was the one who shot the Eldorado teenager dead. Whiteboy admitted in her affidavit read out by her lawyer, Jeff Maluleke, that she was the one who fired the fatal shot. She, however, alleged her co-accused, Simon “Scorpion” Ndyalavane, 46, who is her senior officer, instructed her to pull the trigger. Whiteboy claims that when she fired the gun, she had no idea it was loaded with live ammunition. “I had used the firearm earlier in the day in Freedom Park to successfully disperse a crowd. The gun was loaded with rubber bullets. I was so shocked when I used it later, unbeknown to me that it was loaded with live ammunition.” The 23-year-old officer further stated that she was given the gun by Ndyalavane who booked it out of the station instructing her to shoot. She also alleged that she has been getting death threats from him. Whiteboy’s affidavit alleges Ndyalavane made efforts for her to manufacture evidence against the case. “I have received written WhatsApp death threats from my co-accused applicant one (Ndyalavane) as a result of my cooperation with the state to ensure that the whole truth is told. Ndyalavane offered to pay for my legal fees if I agreed to tailor my version of events, which I refused.” The three officers kept blaming one another, trying to distance themselves from the crime. Ndyalavane denied all counts directed at him, stating he did not shoot Julies. Instead, he rushed to assist him and drove him to Baragwanath Hospital, where he died. Another accused, detective sergeant Foster Netshiongolo, said he was off duty that day. He was called to the hospital, and went to the scene where he removed two spent cartridges from the scene. The bail application was to continue on Wednesday. The Star
