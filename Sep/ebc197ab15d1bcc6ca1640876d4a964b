Johannesburg - “I felt her body next to mine; she was cold. I tried to wake her, felt for a pulse, nothing. I carried her to the shower and tried to revive her. I did CPR but it was too late. “Four years later, the scene still replays in my mind. Such a waste of somebody with so much talent. I would trade places with her if I could.” These words of a former patient of Sanca Wedge Gardens treatment centre in Joburg capture the devastation of losing someone you love to an overdose. International Overdose Awareness Day, held on Monday August 31 each year, gives people a chance to remember those who died due to an overdose of a licit or illicit substance. Worldwide, people are encouraged to show their support by wearing a purple or silver ribbon. Wedge Gardens marked the day by inviting the men undergoing rehab to light a candle in memory of someone they have lost. Adè* Grobbelaar, who heads Wedge Gardens said: “Every overdose is a loss; those ignorant enough to say they deserved it have no understanding. With every overdose, someone loses a son, daughter, friend or loved one. No one has the right to judge. “My wish for you is that you will never feel that hopeless, that overdose appears the only way out. Remember we are here for you and we care.” International Overdose Day aims to: reduce the stigma of a drug-related death; acknowledge the grief felt by families and friends of those who have died of a drug overdose, and spread the message that an overdose death is preventable.
