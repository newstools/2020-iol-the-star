By Kudzai Chikowore The new political party formed recently, Action South Africa, headed by Herman Mashaba, calling for harsher stance on Zimbabwe over human rights abuses and illegal immigration, could solve problems in Zimbabwe and South Africa. Herman Mashaba is the only South African politician who has better ideas of stopping the flow of Zimbabwean illegal migrants into South Africa by punishing members of ruling Zanu-PF with assets in South Africa. South Africans should support this politician who says the bitter truth is that problems in Zimbabwe have resulted in a large scale of Zimbabweans living in South Africa illegally and this has caused discomfort to South Africans. Well done, Herman Mashaba. Quiet diplomacy has failed Zimbabwe and South Africa should be harsh on the irresponsible, reckless Zanu-PF government that has failed Zimbabwe for four decades. I am in solidarity with the idea of freezing assets in South Africa of evil Zanu-PF leaders who mismanage their country and let South Africa pick up the pieces of too many Zimbabwean illegal migrants. South Africa is heavily-affected by Covid-19 and cannot have the capacity to also carry the burden of Zimbabwe which is purely problems of mismanagement of economy and gross corruption. Clueless, careless and corrupt Emmerson Mnangagwa and his government should be removed from power before South Africa is burdened by more migrants from Zimbabwe.
