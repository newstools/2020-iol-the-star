The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) has embarked on a service delivery blitz in tackling potholes and other road defects to clear the backlog accumulated during lockdown and after the heavy December rains. Already 9 400 potholes have been repaired. The blitz, led by mayoral committee member for transport Nonhlanhla Makhuba, moved to Region F (Mayfair, Hillbrow, Kensington and the greater Johannesburg South) yesterday. The blitz resumed last month with the assistance of contractors to fast-track road repairs and other maintenance work. Region F is the second largest region in the city with 1 489km of surfaced road. Areas such as Mayfair, Hillbrow, Kensington and the greater Joburg south are among those prioritised for road repairs. Level 1 and 2 contractors will work with the regional teams throughout the blitz. The “War on Potholes” priority project, which was launched earlier this year by mayor Geoffrey Makhubo, has also completed 1 550 patches and done 998 reinstatements. The backlog happened during lockdown as the JRA was considered a non-essential service, resulting in development of more potholes over that period. The blitz campaign started in Region E on September 8 and was set to continue until the end of this month. Wards 32, 71, 73, 81 and 116 in Region E are among those identified to be in need of urgent attention. During the last week of August, 542 pothole repairs were completed in areas including Alexandra, Far East Bank, Glenhazel, Kew, Cheltondale The team also worked in region C in Bromhof, Boskruin, Florida and surrounding suburbs. Muziwandile Nkonyane, head of regional operations for the JRA, said the focus of the agency is on expediting the repairs of potholes n. “We have a further 2 875 potholes that need work …” said Nkonyane.
