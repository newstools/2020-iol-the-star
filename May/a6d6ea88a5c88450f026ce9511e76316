Johannesburg - The maternity ward at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital has been cleared and disinfected after a patient admitted there tested positive for Covid-19. The hospital had to dedicate other wards to admit pregnant women. The Gauteng Department of Health said the situation reduced the capacity of the general unit beds and there was additional pressure on bed capacity for maternity patients. "There was a confirmed case of Covid-19 at Chris Hani Baragwanath that required the facility to clear the area for disinfecting. "Patients were eventually allocated beds when the process of disinfecting was completed in order to ensure the safety of both staff and patients. "The facility was never shut down at any point. Services continue to be rendered," said Gauteng Health spokesperson Kwara Kekaka. Kekana said there were 41 deliveries on the the night of the confirmed positive case, 19 C-sections and 22 normal births. "The obstetrics protocols remain in place. The whole ward had to be place under quarantine in line with Covid-19 protocols," she said. As of Monday, May 18, the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Gauteng stood at 2 343. There were 1 671 recoveries and 26 deaths while 61 people were in hospital. The department also said there were 10 631 people who were found to have been in contact with people who tested positive for Covid-19. They were traced and put in isolation. According to the department, 8 266 of them have since completed the 14-day monitoring period with no symptoms reported and have been removed from isolation. There are also 161 confirmed Covid-19 cases that the department is yet to allocate to the province's districts.
