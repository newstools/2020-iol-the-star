Snowy conditions were also expected to spread in Lesotho, QwaQwa and the KwaZulu-Natal Drakensberg mountains.     Residents should expect another cold morning with frost across the central interior of the country on Thursday. Joburg will experience clear skies with 15°C maximum and 2°C minimum.     Pretoria will also have clear skies with minimum temperatures of 3°C and maximum of 18°C.

The South African Weather Service said daytime temperatures would gradually start to improve. However, another cold front will be moving over the south-western mountainous region on the Western Cape. This cold front will cause rainfall going into Friday over that region, the south coast and adjacent interior regions.
