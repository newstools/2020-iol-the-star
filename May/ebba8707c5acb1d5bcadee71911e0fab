The National Department of Health was among the attendees who delivered presentations. "The Western Cape presented its hotspot strategy to the group, as the provincial response to the number of infections in nine geographical areas. "These areas - in each of the City of Cape Town's eight sub-districts, and in Witzenberg account for a large proportion of the Western Cape's infections. Using the data and evidence available to us, we will be able to specifically target these areas with responses from across government departments. * For the latest on the Covid-19 outbreak, visit IOL's special #coronavirus page. ** If you think you have been exposed to the Covid-19 virus, please call the 24-hour hotline on 0800 029 999 or visit sacoronavirus.co.za IOL
