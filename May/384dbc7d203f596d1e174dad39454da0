"Government has also worked fervently to increase the number of beds in hospitals across the country in preparation for an influx of patients suffering from Covid-19 symptoms." Commenting on President Cyril Ramaphosa's announcement that most of South Africa can expect to ease into a level 3 lockdown from the end of May, Mkhize said that levels 5 and 4 of the lockdown had allowed government time to strengthen the healthcare system, but he stressed that this had not been without its challenges. "In some instances, data emerging on case numbers in some provinces has been misaligned and sometimes inaccurate. Covid-19 hot spots have emerged in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape, with more than half the country’s cases emanating from the two provinces," Mkhize said. "Cluster outbreaks concentrated in and around Cape Town are driving the pandemic in these regions and require targeted efforts to track and trace contacts in Western Cape and Eastern Cape." * For the latest on the Covid-19 outbreak, visit IOL's special #Coronavirus page. ** If you think you have been exposed to the Covid-19 virus, call the 24-hour hotline on 0800 029 999 or visit sacoronavirus.co.za
