Johannesburg - More than 100 firefighters have come together to build a house for the family of their late colleague. This comes after the family of Samuel Nthoeko Sambo lost their home and belongings in a fire accident last year. Firefighters from various local, district, metropolitan municipalities across the country, private fire services and retired firefighters through their #BrotherhoodClubSA initiative have raised funds to rebuild the house in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni. Joburg Emergency Medical Services spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi said: “The initiative was to help raise funds to rebuild our fallen fighter’s house. Firefighters in service, those who retired and those living abroad came together to assist build the house.” Sambo’s family have been homeless for the past six months. It was during the month of June while parts of the country was experiencing the cold front that the firefighters remembered that the family of one of their own was homeless during this cold weather. The firefighters were able to raise R60000 from their pockets towards the R100000 they had hoped to raise. Sambo tragically lost his life 15 years ago in a motor vehicle accident on his way home from work. Sambo was remembered by his colleagues as a dedicated, disciplined, and selfless firefighter who devoted his entire life to save the lives of others. On Friday, the launch of the rebuilding of the house was held while the sod turning event took place last month. It was hoped that the project would be complete by September and handed over to the family in October. Mulaudzi urged the public together with corporates to donate furniture and appliances for the family. “Although we have managed to raise funds for the building, it’s a three-bedroom house and it still needs furniture. People and companies are welcome to donate furniture,” said Mulaudzi. The Star
