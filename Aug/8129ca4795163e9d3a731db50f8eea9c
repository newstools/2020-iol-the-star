We’ve seen her in the front row of fashion shows, rubbing shoulders with other fashionistas. Even at Parliament seatings like the State Of The Nation Address, she always makes it to the best-dressed list. To celebrate the new beginnings with her, we take a look at some of her hottest fashion looks.

We love the Scottish suit by Smart Tailors. Ain’t perfect but I’m solid and content.... #suit by @smart_tailors 🙌🏼 A post shared by @ norma.mngoma on Jun 25, 2019 at 11:19pm PDT
