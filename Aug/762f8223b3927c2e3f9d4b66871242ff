Johannesburg - Branded backpacks and umbrellas worth R1.9million and digital tablets costing R1.7m are among some of the suspicious items procured by the Mpumalanga Health Department in its fight against Covid-19. Preliminary investigations have indicated that seven departments and agencies in the province misused Covid-19 disaster management funds and bought personal protective equipment (PPE) at inflated prices. According to a leaked report, the entities include Co-Operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta), the Department of Culture, Sports and Recreation, the Department of Health, the Department of Social Development, Mpumalanga Regional Training Trust, Mpumalanga Economic Growth Agency, and provincial Treasury. The report shows fluctuating and inflated amounts of PPE procured by these departments. Mpumalanga Premier Refilwe Mtshweni-Tsipane said: “I have identified a number of discrepancies related to the expenditure patterns and pricing in some departments and agencies. “As a matter of urgency I will be appointing an independent team of investigators that will be tasked with establishing reasons for irregularities.” Thermometers, retailing at between R300 and R1000 a unit, were bought for R2527.20 by the provincial Treasury, and it bought 110 units which cost it R277922. The Trust bought 25 units for R2990 which cost it R74750, while the Sports Department procured 250 thermometers for R2484, which cost it R625233. The report indicated that the provincial Treasury bought 80 25-litre sanitisers for R4220 and R4590 a drum, which cost it R352400. Cogta bought sanitisers worth R4575m. A 25-litre drum of sanitisers usually retails for between R400 and R1800. Raising eyebrows is how the Health Department spent R1.7m on digital tablets, R1082725m on branded backpacks, and R805450 on branded umbrellas. Mtshweni-Tsipane said the Mpumalanga provincial government and its entities had incurred expenditure amounting to R600m since March. The Health Department tops the expenditure list with R444m. DA leader in the province Jane Sithole expressed her frustration and called for a Special Investigation Unit (SIU) intervention. “We are fighting a pandemic and unfortunately I don’t see a reason why our health department spent so much on unnecessary equipment which does not help curb the spread of the virus.” Sithole said the variations in the prices of items between different government departments in the province indicated that funds were stolen. “While some departments paid roughly R1200 to R1800 for digital non-contact thermometers, the majority paid R2527 and upwards per unit, which does not make sense. “Culprits must be identified and brought to book. “The DA calls on the premier and the SIU to urgently investigate and punish Covidprenuers who are milking government departments dry in this province. We also call for a general pricing list and stricter enforcement of the Public Finance Management Act regulations ” Mtshweni-Tsipane said the team of investigators would complete its work in the next two weeks. “If there is prima facie (correct until proved otherwise) evidence of wrongdoing, we shall request the SIU to investigate further. I will allow the head official from the provincial Treasury to provide a detailed analysis of expenditure patterns throughout the various departments and agencies.” The Star
