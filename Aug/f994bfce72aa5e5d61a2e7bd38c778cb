By Staff Reporter Nearly two out of three infants are not exclusively breast-fed for the recommended 6 months - a rate that has not improved in two decades. In observing World Breast-feeding Week from August 1-7, the SA Civil Society for Women’s, Adolescents’ and Children’s Health (SACSoWACH) is focusing on creating an environment that enables and supports women to breast-feed successfully. They said that due to the Covid-19 crisis, women are bearing the brunt of job losses female-headed households, especially, are experiencing a financial shock. Dr Tshepo Motsepe, first lady of South Africa, a patron of the coalition and breast-feeding activist and humanitarian, said breast-feeding is a food source for immunity, neurocognitive development and emotional self-regulation. “The first step to creating a supportive and safe environment for women and children is the essential provision of food for pregnant women and breast-feeding mothers. Safety and protection for moms, as the life-carriers and carers of children, is non-negotiable,” Motsepe said. Addressing whether a mother may breast-feed if she has or thinks she may have Covid-19, the provincial health department said all mothers should continue breast-feeding, as it is the best food for their baby. “So far, coronavirus has not been found in breast milk. Wash your hands with soap and clean water before breast-feeding, and when holding your baby or placing them on your chest (skin-to-skin). Wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth when breast-feeding. Choose two or three people who can help you care for the baby when you are not feeling well. "Make sure they wash their hands and wear a mask before touching the baby. No one should touch or kiss the baby’s face,” the department said. SACSoWACH is hosting a breast-feeding dialogue on Wednesday and will be live-streamed on its website. Visit www.sacsowach.org.za to sign up.
