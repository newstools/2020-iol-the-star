Johannesburg - For the first time, the national census will be conducted digitally. As of Monday,  Statistics SA started conducting a trial for the first digital census to be conducted in the country. The Census 2021 trial will end on September 6 in selected areas across the country. The aim of the trial is to test online and telephonic data collection to prepare for remote data collection in the upcoming Census 2021. The census is typically conducted every five years, but because of a lack of capacity, StatsSA conducts it every 10 years. According to StatsSA, the 2021 population count would be done through online and telephonic data collection methods. StatsSA’s Lesedi Dibakwane said: “The telephonic data collection makes provision for respondents to participate in the census with the assistance of a StatsSA call centre agent. The increased use of cellphones and the current, technology-driven digital era will minimise the challenge of reaching hard-to-access communities, thus allowing more people to participate in the census. “A census provides small area data on demographics, socio-economic and living conditions of the population. “The Act makes it mandatory for respondents to provide data when required. Data collected by StatsSA is only used for statistical purposes” To participate in the census trials, register on the StatsSA website and their social media platforms. Also contact StatsSA on the toll-free number 0800110248. According to StatsSA, there was no reliable information available about the country as a whole prior to the advent of democracy. In 1996, the post-apartheid government conducted its first population census. This was followed by a census in 2001. The next census was scheduled for 2006, but because Statistics South Africa was not in a position to conduct a successful census, this was rescheduled for 2011. A Community Survey took the place of the 2006 census. The Star
