Johannesburg - The Johannesburg metro police department has been commended by a motorist, Melanie de Lange, who was stranded on a busy road without petrol. She has lauded police officers as being “angels” by saving her. “I’m so embarrassed but I am one of those people who don’t check their petrol gauge often enough, and this morning was one of the times I paid the price; sadly,  also not the first time. “Embarrassingly, I was stuck on the Chris Hani Road without petrol. Cars and taxis flying by at speed, often with  hooters blaring out their annoyance at my obstruction, rocking my little car as they flew by. “To say I was apprehensive is an understatement,” she said. Enter Inspector ET Rikhotso. “She jumped into action to ensure a safer environment for me by putting out her warning triangles and then ‘ordered’ me to sit tight and that she was going to get petrol. “A minute before she returned, two more officers stopped and enquired about my predicament and offered assistance. “They directed traffic around me while Inspector Rikhotso returned and put the petrol she brought into my car’s tank. She refused my offer of reimbursement for the petrol, saying it was fine and not to worry. “They were joking around to ease my obvious distress. Even when I asked them if I could take a photo, they jokingly reminded me of social distancing when I asked them to stand closer together. “In one day I was presented with not one, but three people who, for me, truly represent what ‘leading by example’ is. “They turned a stressful event into such a positive reminder of ‘doing good’ for me. “I want to express my appreciation for these three incredible officers and recognise them for the selfless service and assistance they provided.” The Star
