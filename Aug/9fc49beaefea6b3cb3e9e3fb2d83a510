Johannesburg - Personal trainer *Leroy has seen little to no income since the lockdown started, and as a result is very close to losing his rental home. Leroy, from Cape Town, told The Star on Thursday that he had been renting his home for R4200 a month for the past two years. He said that his financial problems started when the national state of disaster was declared in March and his income started to decrease. He added that the situation became worse after the country went under lockdown and gyms and fitness centres were closed. He has been able to make enough money to put food on the table through online training sessions. “I tried to negotiate with my landlord, to the point of giving up,” he said. Leroy said his landlord allegedly only allowed him to pay half of his rent for about a month. “I wasn’t able to earn that half-rent so I had to hustle and borrow money to afford to have a roof over my head at night,” he said. The personal trainer also has car payments to make and a child to take care of. “My car was covered but rental threats started coming in I couldn’t pay the full price and my landlord also needed the money. I understood, because this is their livelihood,” he said. Leroy said that in order to survive and afford to stay in his home, he’s had to apply for a loan. “I don’t even know how I’m going to pay that loan back because I don’t know when the gyms will open again,” he said. *Not his real name.
