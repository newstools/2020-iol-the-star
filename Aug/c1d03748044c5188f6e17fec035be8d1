Dr Philip Finkie Molefe, one of the country's most influential religious figures, has succumbed to a short illness at the age of 92. According to Phil Molefe, his son and family spokesperson, his father, pictured, died a natural death. “He was at an advanced age. All along he was fine, only last week he started getting sick and his situation got worse and he officially passed away on August 1. His death cannot be attributed to Covid 19,” he said. Molefe will be laid to rest on Saturday with the memorial service scheduled to take place on Thursday. Molefe spent more than 70 years in the ministry in which he carried out his work with pride and dignity. He became the pioneer of the Gospel movement in the Vaal Triangle, establishing the first Assemblies of God mission at Top Location in Vereeniging in 1952. His passion for his work proved to be unshaken when he continued preaching the word of God to multiracial audiences across the globe. He was at the forefront of the formation of the South African Council of Churches to resist the apartheid policies. The church led the community and became the voice of the voiceless. He was also part of the clergy that conducted the service for the mass burial of the 1960 Sharpeville victims. Molefe helped mentor several apostles, prophets, evangelists, teachers and pastors who are still spreading the word of God across the globe. He will be buried at Sharpeville Cemetery, a few metres away from the fallen heroes of the Sharpeville Massacre. “He will be buried next to my mother and that is what he wanted. He has served the country with a great deal of pride,” his son said. Molefe is survived by nine children.
