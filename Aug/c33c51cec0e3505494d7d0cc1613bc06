Durban - The death of a 16-year-old Down Syndrome boy has sparked violent protests in the Johannesburg suburb of Eldorado Park earlier today.

According to reports, the teen became excited and police shot at him. He was then taken to the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital where he died a short while later.
