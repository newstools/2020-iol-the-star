The Department of Sports, Arts and Culture has set up a second wave of Covid-19 relief funding worth R77million. Beneficiaries will be entitled to R2200 for three months, starting in September. Minister Nathi Mthethwa said the second batch of funding would take into account the shortcomings and experiences of the first roll-out. Applicants will be required to provide proof of having earned income through arts, culture and heritage activities. This can be done in the form of providing contracts, invoices, bank statements and municipal trading permits in the 12-month period ending in February 2020. The minister said individuals who depended on gigs, such as freelancers, independent contractors and other creatives whose income was generated from participating in sports, arts, culture and heritage activities would be eligible. Mthethwa said R11m of the R77m had been ring-fenced for a partnership with small business development. In the first wave of funding, the department received 5322 applications in the categories of sport, digital, arts, culture and heritage. The Solidarity Fund has also come through for the department with 10000 food or cash vouchers of R700 amounting to R7m. The department will collaborate with provinces to put together a list of beneficiaries in both urban and rural areas. Last month the Gauteng department of Sports, Arts, Culture and Recreation came to the rescue for informal athletes and artists in various townships across the province with a R28-million relief fund. MEC, Mbali Hlophe, emphasized that a lot of informal athletes and artists had not able to benefit from the R150 million relief fund, distributed by the national government. Successful beneficiaries of the fund were to get R1000 from July until December.
