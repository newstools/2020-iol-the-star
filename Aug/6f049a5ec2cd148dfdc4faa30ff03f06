By Adamus P Stemmet The Public Protector’s office is supposed to offer hope to citizens in the fight against maladministration. Instead of facilitating redress, it adds insult to injury. On February 5 and again on February 16, 2016, I asked the PP to investigate certain matters and investments made on behalf of the Government Employees Pension Fund. The lack of interest displayed by the office became clear when, seven months later, at the end of September 2016, I was asked to prove that I had raised the matter with the public protector. This I could do easily because on both dates my representations were handed in at the PP’s office and I could produce the receipts. I was shocked today to learn that the office issued a report on the matter, on May 21 this year, without having the decency to inform me of the existence of the report. It is common courtesy to provide a final report to the complainant first. It is also standard operating procedure in the PP’s office. I have not been informed of the final outcome and have not received a report from the public protector’s office. It is a big disappointment to have this first-hand experience of the poor service, arrogance and lack of professionalism displayed by the handling of my complaint. Based on this, there is no way I can recommend to any citizen to use that office. If they expect service of the highest standard, they should rather consider alternative service providers or avenues or they should wait for a change in leadership at the office. The Star
