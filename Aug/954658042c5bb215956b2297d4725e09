Johannesburg – Merafong residents have received a new multimillion-rand community library to encourage the culture of reading in the area. The virtual handover was by Gauteng MEC for Infrastructure Development and Property Management, Tasneem Motara. The Kokosi community library is set to service 150 000 members. The Department of Sports, Arts, Culture and Recreation, led by Mbali Hlophe was also part of the handover. The R13 million facility in the West Rand is part of seven libraries to be constructed by the Department of Infrastructure Development. Motara said: “Kokosi Library is one of seven libraries being constructed by the department for our client, the Department of Sports, Arts, Culture and Recreation across Gauteng communities.” Infrastructure Development spokesperson Bongiwe Gambu said Merafong was chosen as part of the provincial government’s plans to revitalise economically. “Social infrastructure is known to be at the root of attracting economic investments and government believes this will happen when we as Gauteng invest in communities we want to see grow economically,” he said. Merafong was the second of the seven libraries to be handed over. Atteridgeville community library was handed over in March, with Boipatong, Rustervaal, Akasia and Impumelelo libraries to follow. The project started in November 2017 and was completed in August last year. From construction to completion, 30% of scope of work was outsourced from local suppliers and 177 Expanded Public Works Programme work opportunities were created. Motara asked the Merafong community to take care of the library. “I would like to urge the community of Merafong to take care of this new addition to your community’s social infrastructure. Protect this facility, take care of it, honour it and preserve it for your children” he said. The Star
