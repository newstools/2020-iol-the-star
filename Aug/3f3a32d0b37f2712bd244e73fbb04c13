Moving classes online has meant that lecturers have had to adapt their teaching methods to suit the medium. To make this transition easier, a University of KwaZulu-Natal lecturer and researcher has come up with a framework to assist with adapting to online learning. The framework was developed by academic in Information Systems and Technology, Dr Upasana Singh as part of her research on the impact of Covid-19 on academics. The framework called the ASSET© (Academic SkillSET) for online teaching, learning and assessment is currently being pilot tested and will be validated, through interaction with academics at higher education institutions. Singh has invited more than 500 academics from 18 countries to participate in the pilot. She hopes to implement the validated ASSET© framework as an electronic tool by the end of this year for academics to ascertain their areas of strength and opportunities for them to improve their skills. Some of the things the skills that will be taught through the framework include digital literacy, digital identity and emotional intelligence. Singh said working from home also poses new challenges for academics. “Many academics are teaching from their personal spaces, and this will have its challenges - there may be a baby crying in the background during a lecture, or disruption if technology fails. “Academics must also be kinder and more patient with each other. Supporting each other is critical in this environment, so if someone has learnt one useful tool, it is important to try and share this knowledge with others.” The Star
