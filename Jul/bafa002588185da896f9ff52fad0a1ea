Johannesburg - Ekurhuleni Emergency Services firefighters spent eight hours fighting a blaze that erupted at a petrol station in Boksburg on Sunday evening. It's believed the blaze started when a veld fire spread to the Engen petrol station. Although the petrol pumps and the convenience shop did not catch fire, the tyre store was razed. Part of the premises that stored old tyres was razed to the ground. A wendyhouse was also destroyed. Despite efforts to bring the fire under control, on Monday morning it was still smouldering. However, fire fighters were still at the scene, ready to contain the fire if it sparked up again.     Massive fire at a petrol filing station in Brakpan.
