By Editorial While the virus has disrupted our lives, killed thousands and destroyed jobs and livelihoods, it has also provided a silver lining for the crooked to get rich quickly. Reports have emerged of how some funds were stolen in the Eastern Cape, the same province - one of the hardest-hit by the virus - where a scooter-ambulance scandal involving millions of rand in public funds refuses to go away, despite official denials. This week, it emerged that eThekwini had splurged R8 million on virtual concerts. Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda suspended the project while questions swirled on how the money was used. We believe the examples are just the tip of the iceberg and that across the country Covid-19 funds are not safe from those hoping to lay their dirty hands on the billions made available to fight the virus. We call on the government to make public the list of all companies and individuals who have benefited from the fund. We must scrutinise the list and get answers on how the contracts were awarded and check if those who got the money delivered the work. If there is nothing untoward, then this must not become a problem.
