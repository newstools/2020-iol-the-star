Cape Town – A further 93 Covid-19-related deaths were reported on Monday – six from KwaZulu-Natal, 11 from Mpumalanga, 16 from the Free State, 37 from the Western Cape and 23 from the Eastern Cape – Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said. It brings the total number of Covid-19-related deaths in the country to 4 172, he said in a statement. With the number of infections countrywide increasing by 11 554, a total of 287 796 Covid-19 cases have been reported. The number of recoveries stand at 138 241, which translates to a recovery rate of 48%.

Nearly one in nine people in the world are going hungry, with the coronavirus pandemic exacerbating already worsening trends this year, according to a United Nations report. And the raging coronavirus pandemic has the potential to get far worse if all nations do not adhere to basic healthcare precautions, the World Health Organisation warned on Monday. While wearing an "appropriate item that covers the nose and mouth" in a public place is mandatory, it is still not a criminal offence to go without, the government confirmed on Monday. "It must be embarrassing to move around without a mask. It must be cool to wear a mask," Minister of Justice and Correctional Services Ronald Lamola said. Meanwhile, lobby group AfriForum has withdrawn its High Court application dealing with the repatriation of South Africans and the quality of quarantine facilities. * If you think you have been exposed to the Covid-19 virus, please call the 24-hour hotline on 0800 029 999 or visit sacoronavirus.co.za
