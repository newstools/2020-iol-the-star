She said the community had conducted a search for her and she was found that night with assault wounds.

A case of murder was opened at Phoenix SAPS. Police detectives found a blood-stained stick near the park. Mbele urged witnesses to come forward. Councillor Pete Graham said this was the second incident he had heard of in the past few months. He expected to interview the family of the rape victim today. “I will bring in specialist trauma counsellors. This is a tragic event that has affected the whole community.

I am shocked at the age of the (alleged) perpetrator.” Phoenix Community Policing Forum’s (CPF) Umesh Singh said he understood the community’s frustration, but did not encourage people to take the law into their own hands.
