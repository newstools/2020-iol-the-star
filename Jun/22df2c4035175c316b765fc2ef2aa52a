"We have now screened just over 3 million people (3 025 199). This is good progress considering the total population of North West now stands at just below 4 million (3 961 698) people," said spokesperson Thapelo Lekgwethwane. "Mass screening and contact tracing remains key to prevention of rapids infections and all districts (in North West) are above 90 percent contact tracing and all suspected cases are referred for testing." He said North West Covid-19 laboratory confirmed cases contribute less than 1 percent to South Africa's burden of cases.   Meanwhile, exacerbating the challenges facing health workers in the Western Cape is that at least two hospitals have already witnessed significant increases in admissions this week due to alcohol-related trauma. * For the latest on the Covid-19 outbreak, visit IOL's special #Coronavirus page. ** If you think you have been exposed to the Covid-19 virus, please call the 24-hour hotline on 0800 029 999 or visitÂ sacoronavirus.co.za
