Cape Town - One Cape Town driver used the past weekend's wet weather to push his car to the limit, and satiate his need for speed. A Nissan Sentra was being driven fast on a slippy road, which appears to be onÂ Victoria Road - theÂ long road that stretches from Sea Point all the way to Hout Bay. In the recorded video footage, the driver of the green car can be seen losing control and then crashing into the bushes along the road. Another driver, who was filming the whole incident, slows down his car while onlookers examine the car crash. The 20-second video, which was posted to Twitter on Monday has already been watched more than 17 000 times. Western Cape Transport and Public Works Department's spokesperson JandrÃ© Bakker said they strongly condemn reckless and negligent driving. "We further strongly condemn speeding. Not only does the driver put themselves and those of their passengers at risk, but also those of innocent road users." Bakker said they would not hesitate to act against those who make themselves guilty of such behaviour. "It is important to remember that road safety is a joint responsibility and we need the public to be our eyes and ears on the road. We request the public to report such behaviour by logging it on our Safely Home Reporter and upload any proof and as much details as they have. This will improve the likelihood of successful law enforcement," he said.     Cape Town drivers ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ pic.twitter.com/k3GWJG3x5P sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za Cape Argus
