By John Whitlock Freedom of expression and freedom of association is documented in the Constitution, Bill of Rights, sections 17 and 18, respectively. It states: “Everyone has the right to freedom of association” and “the right to peaceful assembly”. Nowhere in the Constitution does it force anyone to associate with another race just because of skin colour or on the say-so of some officious government official. This means that one is free to have a braai or party with either only black friends or only white friends – as one chooses. If black parents at Brackenfell High School are concerned about race, why did they not organise a private party consisting of black learners only? No white parents would have complained. Why must black learners be forced onto white parents who organised a private party for their children’s friends? Utter nonsense! Why are whites always being targeted? Is there a hidden agenda? The SA Democratic Teachers Union’s provincial chairperson Justin Rustin’s statement that “it did not reflect well on the school and parent community” is codswallop. The party had nothing to with the school, racism or the polarisation of the school community. It’s the parents’ freedom of choice that should be respected. Since when can Rustin demand that the party organisers must apologise to (black) learners, who were excluded, and their parents? What arrogance! He is interfering with people’s private lives and has no right to do so. In no way must parents apologise. They were well within their rights. Why must teachers be appointed solely on the colour of their skin and not on teaching qualifications, ability and experience? Is there now a quota system in education? The best teachers must be selected. Multicultural education is a disaster and has been for 26 years. The sooner government realises it, the better. It’s causing more polarisation than it is worth.
