Johannesburg - Two men have been arrested for the murder of an off-duty  Crime Intelligence Officer who was gunned down in Eldorado Park Extension 1 on Thursday evening. The officer was chatting with an acquaintance outside a spaza shop when two men on foot approached them and shot him multiple times before disappearing the dark. The other man was not injured during the shooting. Police spokesperson Colonel Brenda Muridili said the officer  was certified dead at the scene after sustaining multiple gunshot wounds to his upper body. The motive for the murder, she said, was yet to be determined and that nothing was taken from the officer. Muridili said that shortly after the killing, a 72-hour Activation Plan was immediately mobilised to find the killers and an intelligence-led integrated team was put together. "It comprised the Hawks,  K9 Units of the Johannesburg Metro Police Department and the SAPS in Soweto, the Specialised Law Enforcement Unit from Gauteng Traffic Police as well as other law enforcement disciplines. “Within 24 hours, the team traced and arrested two suspects aged 35 and 40 in Eldorado Park. “In the meantime, further investigations are underway to establish possible linkage of the suspects to other crimes. At this point, the two have been linked to an attempted murder case reported at Eldorado Park SAPS after the fatal shooting of the member,” she said. National Commissioner, General Khehla John Sitole, has commended “the tireless efforts” of the multi-disciplinary team who managed to nab the suspects quickly following the murder. "No suspect linked to the murder of a police officer should ever get to roam the streets free. I am glad that these two alleged police killers are behind bars. I therefore urge the investigating team to ensure that they build a solid case to present in court to ensure that these men eventually receive harsh sentences," said Sitole. IOL
