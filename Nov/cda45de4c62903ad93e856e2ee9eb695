Johannesburg - Researchers at the University of Pretoria (UP) are producing unique nanobodies that might be used in rapid tests and as a therapy for Covid-19. In tests conducted in collaboration with the National Institute for Communicable Diseases, the nanobodies have been shown to neutralise SARSCoV-2 in cells. According to Professor Tahir (TS) Pillay, head of Pathology and Chemical Pathology at the UP/National Health Laboratory Service, Steve Biko Academic Hospital, who is leading this research, the nanobodies can be used to design rapid tests. “Nanobodies can also be used to design ‘dipstick’ tests, to test saliva, and produce a result in a few minutes, like a pregnancy test. These can be used in communities and homes for Covid-19 diagnosis. They can also be used in an airport testing centre.” Pillay has started collaborating with a Taiwanese company to build a microchip with the nanobody on the surface for an electronic biosensor to detect Covid-19. “This will be used to create a handheld device that could be used in an airport, for example, using saliva. A major advantage of nanobodies is that they are heat-stable and do not require refrigeration, so they can be easily transported,” he said. For using nanobodies as a therapy, Pillay said “a nanobody can be produced to act against any protein antigen if you have enough of the protein”. Alpacas are immunised with the protein, and the gene for the nanobody is isolated from the animal’s blood. In the case of Covid-19, any of the viral proteins can be used. The nanobody will prevent viral particles from binding to cells. In the case of Covid-19, the nanobody can be delivered via inhalation into the lungs or intravenously. If it is administered intravenously, it could work similarly to plasma therapy. The Star
