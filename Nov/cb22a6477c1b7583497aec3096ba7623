By Stan Mazhindu President Cyril Ramaphosa and the National Coronavirus Command Council were wise not to take the country back to stricter lockdown levels despite rising Covid-19 infections in some parts of the country. Limiting trade and the resultant damage to the economy is the last thing the country needs. Emphasis should be on growing the economy and creating employment. Travel from all countries will assist in bringing the tourism and travel industry back to its feet. The sector will hopefully be back in full operation soon, now that foreign visitors are allowed into South Africa. Millions of workers and businesses will benefit from the extension of the Temporary Employer/Employee Relief Scheme (Ters) Benefit up to October 15, and the extension of the Covid-19 grant for a further three months, until January. Our trade union, UASA, is pleased that the Department of Basic Education is recruiting teacher and school assistants, targeting unemployed youth. We hope the locally-manufactured Covid-19 vaccine will also play a role in alleviating unemployment. We encourage everyone to adhere to the health and safety measures. If we do not protect ourselves and those around us, the country might be placed under stricter lockdown. The South African economy cannot afford another hard lockdown. If everyone wears a mask in public, sanitises and practices physical distancing, we can prevent a resurgence and maintain alert level 1. Let us keep one another safe.
