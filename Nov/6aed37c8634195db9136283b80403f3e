Johannesburg - Joburg mayor Geoff Makhubo is facing a new battle. Civil society movement Right to Justice has launched a legal attack against him, calling on the courts to intervene for the removal of the Johannesburg Property Company board. It’s taking Makhubo to court for “protecting political relationships at the expense of the poor”. This action follows the ANC’s break-up with the Patriotic Alliance (PA), forcing the PA member and economic development MMC Lloyd Phillips to step down. PA leader Gayton McKenzie is also taking the ANC in Joburg to court following their split. In an affidavit seen by The Star, Right to Democracy accuses Makhubo of keeping a board that is conflicted in office. “At the departure of the MMC, the mayor should have sought a new and clean board to serve the interests of the city and its people,” the organisation said. Gauteng Co-operative Governance MEC Lebogang Maile also lambasted Makhubo, accusing him of bad leadership, and questioning his failure to pass the budget, the irregular appointment of senior managers and board members, and Covid-19 corruption. The mayor said he would respond to Maile within seven days, but there has been no response yet. Johannesburg Property Company has been dogged by in-fighting after the board suspended the entity's chief executive, Helen Botes. Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has also been approached to investigate allegations of corruption and improper conduct at the municipal entity. The board is also under investigation after it has been accused of meddling in management issues and using its powers to make appointments in management which were favourable to the board. The Star
