Johannesburg - The newly appointed chairperson of the Commission for Gender Equality (CGE), Jamela Ellen Robertson, said that despite concerns over the process to appoint her, she got the job on merit. During the interview stages, civil society organisations raised concerns about the recruitment process, with claims that former chief executive Keketso Maema was sidelined for the position as she is not South African. Robertson said: “Generally I refrain from talking about things I don’t know. I’ve been here for a week and I bring in my own outlook. What happened before I came here, I can’t comment on. I want to work with the team to resolve whichever issues they have. “One thing I am 100 percent sure of is that out of the blue I saw an advert and I applied and got the job. I had no relationship whatsoever that I can say influenced me to come to the CGE. That’s one thing I am thankful for; my whole professional life I have never been to a job where I was done a favour. I am proud that I got appointed on merit. You don’t know how that feels. I sleep like a baby at night because I know I got this job on merit.” Robertson, who has occupied the post for just two weeks, said she would ask the staff about historical issues and deal with them in a transparent manner to ensure a healthy working environment. She said she was up to the CGE job challenge as she has been working in the sector for over 20 years. “The CGE is where the real stuff happens. One was collecting experience for when one walked into an organisation mandated by the constitution to uphold gender equality. “The commission has been working and achieving so much with so little. It is amazing when you get into the commission and see how committed staff members are, how committed commissioners are. They have been doing a good job,” Robertson said. She said at the top of her agenda was working together with civil society and communities to end gender-based violence. The Star
