By Dan L Nkosi The scourge of gender-based violence calls for the powers that be to make difficult, immediate decisions. Many South Africans are no longer moved when politicians speak about GBV. Politicians seem not to hear themselves when they make their rhetoric. It is done for political correctness. Part of our problem as a society is that, while our abuse of woman, rape and murder statistics are among the worst in the world, we want to present ourselves as the universal paragon of human rights. The reality is that we seem more concerned about the human rights of murderers, rapists and child molesters. The situation has reached extreme proportions, way beyond the reach of the policing and justice system’s capabilities. This might be the reason many cases go unreported. Victims suffer “double jeopardy” when the criminals they have tried to report, come back to either “finish” them or show them the middle finger. The few who are arrested and the even fewer who are convicted return to society more hardened. Using a full Bench of judges to decide death penalty cases will go a long way in mitigating the chances of a mistaken conviction, that is so often quoted by the minuscule number of opponents of the death penalty. If the perpetrators knew there was a chance that they may be sentenced to death, they would think twice. Our political leaders would do well to lead the way. We owe it to our women and children.
