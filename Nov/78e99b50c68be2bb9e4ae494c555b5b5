Johannesburg - Department of Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga and provincial MECs were on Monday stuck in an urgent meeting discussing the alleged leak of another matric exam paper. The Department of Basic Education last week confirmed that the maths Paper 2 had been leaked. On Monday, a man who said he tutored pupils in physical science claimed that he had received Paper 2 in the subject from a pupil in the early morning. Candidates sat for the exam at 9am on Monday and the man shared screen shots of the alleged exam on Twitter before it started. By the afternoon, he had deleted the tweets. The department said it had become aware that maths Paper 2 had been leaked when a Gauteng university student who helped matric candidates prepare for exams sent the paper to spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga a few hours before the assessment commenced. The student had received the paper from the pupils he mentors and they wanted assistance on how to answer some of the questions. The department is expected to release their first investigation results at the end of November and decide whether candidates need to rewrite or not. The department had not commented on the latest leak by the time of publication last night. Motshekga said the department had asked The Hawks to investigate the latest leak. The Star
