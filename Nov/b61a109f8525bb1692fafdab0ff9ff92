By Thabile Mange Donald Trump is the worst president the US ever had. Trump lacks diplomacy, wit and charm. He is also arrogant, rude and egotistical. Worse, he has no respect for women. How did Americans elect such a leader? He also presided over a poor economy and believed Covid-19 (which he called the “China virus”) was a hoax. He didn’t put on a mask when in public. As fate would have it, he tested positive with Covid-19. Not long ago, the US held the presidential elections. Trump was up against the Democrats candidate, Joe Biden. Biden, who was Barack Obama’s vice president, has been in politics for a very long time. Over the last weekend, the presidential election results were announced. Biden has won. Trump thought he had a natural right to power. At the back of his mind, it was a forgone conclusion he was going to be re-elected as the country president. It was not to be. South Africans’ voting behaviour is different from that of Americans. South Africans vote on the basis of sentiment, not performance and policy. That explains why one political party has been in power for more than 25 years in this country. On the other hand, Americans change government every now and then. Having said that, South African voters can learn something from the Americans: that they don’t have to vote on the basis of sentiment. And if a political party no longer serves them, they should vote it out. That simple. The Star
