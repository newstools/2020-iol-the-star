Johannesburg – The family of the teenager who was found dead at his school’s swimming pool in January are a step closer to finding out the truth about events that led to their child’s death. The naked, lifeless body of Keamohetswe Shaun Seboko, 13, was discovered at the bottom of a swimming pool at Laerskool Bekker in Magaliesburg just after schools reopened this year. His mother, Lucia Seboko, said at the time that she did not believe it was a drowning. She said not only was her son a good swimmer who had been swimming since he was 4 years old, when his body was found there was a cut next to his lip on his right cheek, a cut across the back of his neck and also on top of his head. “This is not a drowning. I suspect somebody must have pinned him down,” she said at the time. On Friday, Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi was expected to visit the family to present an investigative report on the incident Keamogetswe and other learners were allegedly under the supervision of a caretaker from the school when he went missing. The post-mortem found that Keamogetswe had several litres of water in his stomach, which is why Seboko believes her son may have been held underwater for a long time. His underpants were also found floating in the water. “Your clothes don’t just come off when you drown. Somebody must have pulled his swimming shorts and jockey down. He was wearing cotton shorts with elastic. Cotton with elastic doesn’t leave your body in water, it clings to it,” Seboko said. IOL
