Johannesburg – The cash-strapped ANC wants the judgment that found it obligated to pay R102 million to a marketing agency that produced and installed thousands of its 2019 election banners set aside. Acting Judge U Bhoola heard in her chamber at the South Gauteng High Court on Tuesday the party’s application for leave to appeal her previous ruling that went in favour of Ezulweni Investments. The ANC maintained its officials, Nhlanhla Mabaso and Lebohang Nkholise, who gave Ezulweni boss Renash Ramdas the go-ahead, had not been authorised by treasurer-general Paul Mashatile to do so. Finance manager Mabaso and procurement officer Nkholise agreed with Ramdas his group would supply 30 000 banners. The party, with the officials agreeing, was charged R2 900 per banner for installation and R70 for removal after the elections. Ezulweni’s lawyers detailed meetings and WhatsApp communication between Ramdas, Mabaso and Nkholise discussing the progress of the banners project. In her judgment, Judge Bhoola ruled all evidence before her proved that Ezulweni entered into a bona fide oral agreement with the governing party. “Accordingly, in my view, the evidence establishes firmly that Mabaso and Nkholise were directly authorised by the ANC, which authorisation was expressed in the case of Nkholise and tacit in the case of Mabaso,” she said. After the oral agreement with the ANC officials, Ezulweni produced and installed 30 000 PVC banners as part of the party’s last-push strategy before the 2019 general elections. It installed the banners on poles across all provinces. But after the elections, the ANC refused to pay Ezulweni despite its numerous demands. “There is no evidence that the T-G (Mashatile) approved the agreement. Nor is there evidence of a purchase order,” said the ANC in court papers. “Ramdas knew or must have known he was the only representative authorised to conclude the agreement.” Judge Bhoola reserved judgment.
