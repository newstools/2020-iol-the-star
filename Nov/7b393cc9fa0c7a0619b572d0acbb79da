Johannesburg - A violent brawl involving about 10 high school boys in Gauteng was because one of them was owed R25. A video circulating on social media shows boys, some in school uniform, viciously fighting in groups outside Edenglen High School in Edenvale. About four of the boys involved in the fight don’t attend Edenglen. Several schoolgirls watch as the different brawls go on. Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi this week visited Edenglen High School to get to the bottom of the fight and it was revealed that the boys were fighting over R25. The department is now trying to identify pupils involved in the fight, but who don’t go to the school. “We can’t allow this type of behaviour. “We can’t have this kind of conduct in our schools,” Lesufi said, adding that they had asked the police to assist in identifying those who were involved, but might not be pupils. Disciplinary action has been taken by the school governing body (SGB) and psychosocial support has been offered to all involved. Chairperson of the SGB Graeme Stratton said: “We are deeply saddened that this happened at our school. We will make sure all the pupils involved are identified and we will take the necessary action. ‘We condemn in no uncertain terms what happened. No pupil should be involved in this and we will make sure it doesn’t happen again.” This is the latest in a series of violent altercations involving school children this year. In September the KwaZulu-Natal education department suspended two pupils after a video emerged of a girl pupil assaulting another one. The bully repeatedly hit her victim, forcing her to the ground, then tearing her underwear while other learners watched at Matholo High School. The Star
