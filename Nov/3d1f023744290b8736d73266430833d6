The SA Mathematics Foundation (SAMF) and Old Mutual hosted the 2020 Annual Awards Function on Saturday. Andi Qu, a St John’s College Grade 12 learner scooped the award for Best Young Mathematician in this year’s senior division and Minkyum Kim (Grade 9) from Reddam House Durbanville was named Best Young Mathematician in the junior division of the Old Mutual SA Mathematics Olympiad, that is co-sponsored by the SA Institute for Chartered Accountants. In his keynote address Professor Jonathan Jansen, former rector and vice-chancellor of Free State University, said that “so much of our system of education is built on mediocrity, built on just getting by”. “There is something in the way we teach maths that doesn’t encourage people to think laterally, to be more efficient, to get to an answer in their own way because we are so traditional and rule-bound,” he said. “Apart from its intellectual values, maths also has social values. It teaches you how to solve problems together,” Jansen said. SAMF executive director Professor Kerstin Jordaan said South Africa needed a larger quantity and better quality of mathematically skilled people.. “The learners, schools, and volunteers who received recognition today are proof that we are well on our way to making an impact. Congratulations to everyone who received rewards and thank you to all the teachers and parents who make these achievements possible,” Jordaan said. The Star
