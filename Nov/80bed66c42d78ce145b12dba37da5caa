Johannesburg - The legitimacy and validity of City of Johannesburg alleged fraudster Brighton Kuzovamuhu Chifamba’s passport has proven to be the stumbling block in his quest for bail. This comes after Chifamba’s bail application was refused at the Palm Ridge Specialised Commercial Crimes Court on Tuesday. The 49-year-old and Setheo Engineering, a firm linked to him, are accused of swindling R66 million from the city’s coffers. Both the prosecution and defence presented their heads of argument in Chifamba’s bail hearing. However, an affidavit penned by an official from the Department of Home Affairs and testimony has put Chifamba’s release in jeopardy. The State opposed bail on the basis that Chifamba is a flight risk and that his disputed visa makes him an illegal immigrant. The magistrate ruled that he could not grant bail until Chifamba’s immigration status was clarified. The court heard that Chifamba was arrested on October 12, after voluntarily presenting himself to the Hawks. At the time, his immigration status was not an issue. Following his arrest, investigations by Home Affairs, at the request of the National Prosecuting Authority, revealed that Chifamba had entered the country on March 6 and that his entry was endorsed on his passport. Chifamba entered the country under the 90-day visa exemption programme granted to all Zimbabwean passport holders. It emerged in court proceedings that although Chifamba was entitled to remain in the country for 90 days, the record on his passport indicates that on March 23 he left the country for Zimbabwe, only to return on March 25. It is the legitimacy of the entry stamp of March 25 that convinced the presiding magistrate otherwise and also considering that the Home Affairs investigator told the court that the entry stamp was fraudulent.
