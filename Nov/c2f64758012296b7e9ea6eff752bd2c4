By Muhammad Omar While Mbali Ntuli faced a tough challenge, her either gutsy or naive approach got her prominent media. Interesting to note, both leadership contenders were from English speaking Durban (north). The landslide in favour of John Steenhuisen as the leader of the opposition was a surprise, but this probably reflects where and who the party voters really are. With the absence of “The Zuma” group, opposition politics has become more difficult, coupled with by the strengthening of the Freedom Front Plus. What will be critical is the so-called white Afrikaans-speaking vote. It seems the DA has lost this constituency from a donor and voting point, especially in the farming towns. Potchefstroom/Klerksdorp, in the last election, was ground zero and here the FF+ went all out. In the Zuma era, the DA, with other opposition parties, played a prominent role in trying to curtail the excesses and abuse. The era of political liberalism is running out of road and Covid-19 has exacerbated this trend. True liberalism works in an equal, relatively-affluent society only. South Africa is far from that. Some tough talk will have to be included in the DA’s political lexicon. The rise of the right-wing in Europe and the issues between French President Emmanuel Macron and his opposition leader, Marine Le Pen, further highlights this. Macron has had to talk tough given his political opponent. Local government is going to be hotly contested with high municipal costs, with Covid-19 scandals, Eskom and poor governance and accountability. This will be a field day for opposition parties. The road ahead for the DA should be one of vigilance, oversight, inclusivity, and focus on core voters, constructive suggestions and a vision of a government in waiting. The Star
