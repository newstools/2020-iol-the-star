By Editorial In August,  Police Minister Bheki Cele described the decrease in crime as a result of the restrictions imposed by Covid-19 lockdown level four and level three, squeezing the elements of crime that existed in the country and leading to a drastic drop in the number of crimes that were being committed. People were forced to stay at home and there were more boots on the ground. However, crime statistics between July 1 to the end of September 2020, released by Cele last week, reveal that crime is on the rise. Over that period, 5 107 people were murdered in South Africa and of these figures, 900 people were killed in their homes or the homes of those who ended their lives. The link between alcohol consumption and crime cannot be ignored. Ever since the restrictions on the sale of alcohol have been relaxed, police have noted an increase in crime, Cele said. “Figures show that the consumption and abuse of alcohol is a causative factor in many murders “The figures show the consumption and abuse of alcohol is a causative factor in hundreds of murder cases recorded in the second quarter. “Liquor was also involved in 829 assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm cases, and 747 rape cases. 179 attempted murders were alcohol induced. “Over a thousand incidents of murder, attempted murder, rape and assault took place at or outside liquor outlets such as bars, taverns, shebeens and nightclubs. “These figures make it impossible to deny the true effects of alcohol abuse,” Cele said. The link between alcohol consumption and crime is a concern for all South Africans. The Star
