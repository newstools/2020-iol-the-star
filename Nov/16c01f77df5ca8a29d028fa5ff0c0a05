By Cometh Dube - Makholwa It is shocking and disturbing to learn about the demise of the historical Mandela House museum. The first time I visited the museum with a group of friends was such a great experience. Everything was in its original form. The narrow single beds used by the then-little daughters of Winnie, and several pairs of boots that were worn by Mandela during the Struggle were there, including the pair he wore as a miner and the ones he had during his time on Robben Island while prisoners worked in the quarry breaking stones. Also there was the animal skin which was given to him as a symbol of his status of chieftaincy by his tribe, which they had hoped he would be next in line to inherit, though it turned out he had other ambitions and was never going to fulfil their hopes. Years later, when I took some visitors from the Eastern Cape, as I have been there about four times, I was disappointed to find a lot had changed after renovations that were meant to improve the place as a tourist attraction. It has lost that original touch that made it so fascinating. What could have happened to necessitate this ill-advised liquidation of a tourist destination that was the major attraction for tourists from all corners of the world? So sad. I hope the decision will be reviewed. Why does it seem like the departure of Nelson Mandela, Winnie and Zindzi results in the erasure of such valuable, unequalled history never heard of anywhere in the world? Many generations would have much to learn from the sacrifices made by the Mandela family for us to be where we are. The Star
