Johannesburg - There is nothing bad I can ever say about an HP laptop. It doesn’t matter the make, the colour or the shape, the products are superb. As an aesthetics person I am always first attracted to the look and feel of the products. I received the HP 13 for review a few weeks back and, as usual, I fell in love at first sight. The laptop comes in natural silver and pale gold. I had the silver one for two weeks. The box it comes in may fool you into thinking the device is a standard size, but once you’ve opened it, you will find that it is a portable and light laptop. The biggest stand-out for me was the screen display and just how much the colour pops. It comes with NVIDIA GeForce MX350 graphics. The vivid, up to UHD OLED near borderless display ensures colours are vibrant and accurate. The HP Command Centre puts you in control with customisable modes to optimize your performance. You can edit and create photo and video projects in Create mode, while supporting modes help to maximise your PC’s efficiency. The 13-inch diagonal screen makes the laptop feel less small. The HP Sure View Privacy Screen sets you at ease to ensure your privacy. You have the option of a shutter that turns off the camera, you can mute the mic and use the fingerprint reader and privacy screen. It has up to 18 hours of battery life. It comes with a MicroSD Card reader, drop-jaw SuperSpeed USB Type-A3 and an adapter plug, Windows 10 and is a Core i7. And, of course, Bang and Olufsen sound makes it stand out all the more. The Star
