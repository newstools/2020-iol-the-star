That video clearly shows him bending over and asking for money. The Oppenheimer's and Rupert's are no different. No one serves the interests of SA  Patrice Motsepe is smart but was star struck. He told Donald Trump what Donald Trump likes hearing. It was a perfect set up...very strategic or very naive ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èAnyway who cares we are a shithole country right...  Unapologetic capitalists like Dr Patrice Motsepe knows when to play a humility card like he did with US President Donald Trump. Capitalists are brutal in nature and it remains to be seen how far the humility will take Motsepe in the Trump World pic.twitter.com/sCmZxDGNOO  Interview: Tell us about yourselfMe after watching the Patrice Motsepe clip: I love your company. My family loves your company. My village loves your company. Even my ancestors love your company.  Patrice Motsepe save us all in Africa because Donald Trump will not attack Africa for now .Thank you Patrice Motsepe for being a patriot . üôèüôè pic.twitter.com/QYcbHSqr7T  Patrice Motsepe tells Donald Trump 'Africa loves America' but I don't, Does that mean I am not Part of Africa?  I learnt a lot from Patrice Motsepe in one 30 seconds. I‚Äôve got the cheat code now. Let me go get my billions. Twitter can stay complaining alone! ü§£ü§£  Lol did he jus say "Africa loves you?" pic.twitter.com/BJwarBOo31  Having a lot of money is not a measure of intelligence You can have much of it and still be a fool.Cyril Ramaphosa and Patrice Motsepe are just visible examples of that!  He didn‚Äôt have to say any of that nonsense.  ''Africa Loves America'' #PatriceMotsepe pic.twitter.com/nshfOtCKPj  Patrice Motsepe. Africa loves a racist? Narcissistic bigot? Is it about more money?  so Patrice Motsepe is now Africa's spokesperson #djzinhle #Patrice pic.twitter.com/okmLd1FuA5  To be honest it was irresponsible of our national breadwinner to utter such words. He should just said m hpy to be here . Thank u#PatriceMotsepe pic.twitter.com/cRQ8tQ1YOU
