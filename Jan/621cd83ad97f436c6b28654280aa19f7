Apart from its existing service delivery mandate, JCPZ has been faced with concerns from residents over the shortfall of maintenance at the 116- year-old Johannesburg Zoo. A seasonal mega blitz clean-up of the zoo has been scheduled, where each quadrant will focus on its own clean-up work plan for the day, which will include: * Animal enclosures * The Wetland Walk * Memorial Boulevard * Giraffe Run * Buffalo bend * Crocodile country * Kudu camp * Playground area * Anglo Gold Ashanti * Tiger walk * Jungle junction * Wild Dog area * Sasol wing * Farmyard * Gorilla walk, (outside) perimeter around the zoo and more. These areas will receive grass cutting, removal of weeds and dead trees, mulching of flower beds, removal of alien invasive species, identifying and removal of trees infected with the invasive Polyphagous Shot Hole Borer with replacement of indigenous trees, tree pruning, clean-up and litter picking at picnic spots. The few ablution facilities which need attention due to concerns from zoo visitors, are to be repaired for public use. About 200 staff and contractors will be at work to tackle gaps within the zoo as well as the Zoo Lake precinct, where teams in overalls from each region will be hard at work with machinery and protective gear. The massive work at the zoo was expected to start on Saturday at 8.30am.
