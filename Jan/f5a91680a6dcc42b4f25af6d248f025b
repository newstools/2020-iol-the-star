Cape Town â€“ Eskom has confirmed that it will implement Stage 2 load shedding between 9pm on Wednesday and 8am on Thursday. This comes after breakdowns caused the loss of 13 543MW from the grid, according to the power utility, with a chance of load shedding during the day on Thursday. "In order to minimise the impact of load shedding on South Africans, load shedding is scheduled at night to maximise electricity availability during the working day," Eskom said in a statement. "Owing to a loss of additional generation capacity, emergency reserves had to be extensively utilised to supplement capacity during the day. "These now need to be replenished to meet tomorrow's electricity demand. "The power system remains vulnerable and unpredictable with breakdowns (UCLF) sitting at 13 543MW as at 16.30. "In the event that we lose other generation units or unable to bring back those that were out for maintenance, load shedding may be implemented during the day. We will keep customers informed of the status of the power system."
