After the June exams, Lethabo and her classmates started study groups to ensure that no one was left behind. “A very interesting time for me at school was last year, when as a group, the matriculants decided to unite and do something about our results and studying. It was a memorable moment for me because it showed that with unity, anything is possible. Although I have not seen the results yet, I’m very confident that we did well,” Lethabo said. With the study groups, they shared study material and helped those who struggled with certain subjects. “This was necessary, because when people saw their results from June exams and prelims, it scared them a bit because those were a daunting experience, and not everyone received the best marks. It was a wake-up call for all of us to pull up our socks and help each other to work together,” Lethabo said. Working together paid off for her, and she achieved a full house of seven distinctions in Sesotho, maths, physical science, life science, religion studies, English and life orientation. Another top achiever at the school is Lehlogonolo Molatudi, who also had a full house of distinctions in Geography, maths, life science, physical science, religion studies, English and life orientation. Clement Moukangwe received six distinctions in maths, geography, life sciences, Religion Studies, life orientation and physical science. Lethabo plans to study actuarial sciences at Wits University.
