By Editorial We must be very concerned about Maria Ramos’s recent appointment as chairperson of the AngloGold Ashanti board. Ramos has still not accounted for fixing the rand. All the Republic got for her actions was an apology. An apology for rand fixing? Ramos wasn’t criminally charged nor did she face any disciplinary action. But instead she was honoured with a PIC board seat. While she was the group chief executive for Absa, Ramos was also a donor to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s CR17 campaign. Even with the negative publicity surrounding her, last year she was called into the Public Investment Corporation. Her recent appointment should not be celebrated. Absa borrowed money from the then government of national unity to bail out its debtors and form a new bank, the Amalgamation of Banks in South Africa, thus Absa. Former public protector Thuli Madonsela made it clear that she was not going to investigate the matter. One of advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s crimes is that she rattled Absa’s cage when she investigated the Absa bailout and the CIEX report. It’s really bizarre that in out society, Mkhwebane is shunned while Ramos is celebrated. In any other country Ramos would have been charged with treason or corruption, but she won’t be. Rather, she’ll be appointed to chair more boards. With all the talk of fighting corruption, South Africa is a country that applauds and celebrates the corruption of some. The Star
