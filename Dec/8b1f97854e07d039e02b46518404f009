Johannesburg - Jan Venter, the controversial butler of former Mpumalanga premier Mathews Phosa, has made it into the news again. This time Venter brought an urgent application for the high court to interdict his wife. In the application, Venter asks the court to “look into the instances that cause gender-based violence”. Venter states that “whilst courts talk about gender-based violence they should start asking why these things happen”. He further states that “some men get pushed so far that they just can’t take it anymore and the men always get the blame”. Venter, who complained to the Office of Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng that only women get justice in courts, was rebuked for his apparent support of gender-based violence by Justice Davies. His urgent application was dismissed. In a separate matter, Johannesburg attorneys Ulrich Roux and Ian SmallSmith launched an application for the incarceration of Venter for contempt of a court order. Venter requested the court to have him committed to a mental institution to establish if he was “capable of standing trial”. Venter, however, also asked to be admitted to a private institution for observation, blaming his medication for his actions. Venter has now laid criminal charges against National Director of Public Prosecution Shamila Batohi, President Cyril Ramaphosa, Deputy President David Mabuza, Small-Smith and Roux. Venter has also been one of the main collaborators in a recently published book by Rehanna Joubert. The book, Predator Politics, is about the struggle of Mr Fred Daniel against the Mpumalanga government. Daniel is suing the government for R1 billion in damages and Venter is tapped to be one of his witnesses after he previously claimed that he was promised some of Daniel’s land by Mabuza. The court recently found that Daniel abused the judicial process in an attempt to obfuscate his own illegal activities. The Star
