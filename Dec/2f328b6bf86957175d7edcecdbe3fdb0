By Hoodah Abrahams - Fayker The Black Sash welcomes the new auditor-general Tsakani Maluleke’s special audit report concerning the government’s Covid-19 relief package. The report finds that the South African Social Security Agency’s beneficiary validation project for applicants of the Covid-19 Social Relief of Distress (SRD) grant “has not yet borne fruit”. The AG asked Sassa to investigate those who have benefited from the funds meant for the poor. Our national helpline is inundated with queries from applicants who were unsuccessful in accessing the Covid-19 SRD grant, despite them being unemployed. Sassa must urgently ensure that the inadequate verification controls are speedily resolved. Our Covid-19 health, humanitarian and economic crisis will not be resolved as early as January 31. The state is obligated to provide for individuals facing social and economic distress, particularly those aged 18 to 59 years, excluded from social assistance programmes. Black Sash urgently advocates that the R350 Covid-19 SRD grant be extended beyond the end of January and that those who received the caregiver grant, who have no or little income, be eligible to receive the Covid-19 SRD grant.
