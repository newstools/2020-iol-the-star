By Tebogo Brown One cannot help but wonder why governments ignore doctors and scientists who hold a different view regarding Covid-19 and its vaccine. It should be in the public’s interest to give an equal amount of media coverage to two opposing sides. There is, for example, the World Doctors’ Association which consists of more than 51 000 doctors. They have been opposing the narrative of the pandemic, the wearing of masks, physical distancing and the unnecessary lockdowns. With science and medical facts on their side they have been able to maintain this position. But their views are suppressed in the media and their videos banned on social media. Something interesting happened in the UK which the world media turned a blind eye to. On March 19, the public health bodies and the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) decided the new coronavirus infection should no longer be classified as a “high consequence infectious disease”. It was downgraded to common or garden status, like the flu. On March 26, the UK government published a 358-page Emergency Bill giving itself massive powers. The bill turned Britain into a police state. The British people were under house arrest. The South African government followed suit and announced the lockdown for 21 days from March 26, the day the UK government published the bill and ignoring sound medical advice from ACDP doctors and scientists. Why is our government ignoring critical information? This kind of news should have been in the front pages of. Why such an urgent need to vaccinate the world over a virus whose existence is questionable? Worse, there are people who do not know that the coronavirus was downgraded to “flu”. Governments prey on our ignorance. The Star
