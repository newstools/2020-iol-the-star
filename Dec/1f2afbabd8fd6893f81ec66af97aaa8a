Johannesburg - Plans to “de-densify” informal settlements in Alexandra with a promise of 4 581 units by this month have come to nothing, despite more than R280 million being spent by the Johannesburg Social Housing Company (Joshco). The DA in Joburg says the plan was supposed to be one of the key responses to Covid-19 put forward by Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu, and, like other failed housing projects in the country, Joburg has been no exception. DA councillor David Brand: “In an official response to my question in the Joburg council, IFP mayco member for housing Mlungisi Mabaso claimed that no feasibility study had been done before funds were spent on de-densifying parts of Alexandra, and that a business or project plan was available, but now will only be presented in February 2021. This begs the question: to what plans are Joshco working and spending money? There are less than 10 units on site, and these are apparently being used to relocate residents of the derelict Madala Hostel, while others are being used to provide temporary accommodation to residents from other areas. “In effect, no de-densification has taken place, and Joshco has little to show for the millions spent.. “The most vulnerable residents deserve better. There is plenty of good evidence and solid case studies around relocations through informal settlement upgrading, and a well-run city which is committed to service delivery should be able to plan properly in order to provide these important services,” said Brand. Metrowatch did not elicit a response to a request for comment. The Star
