Johannesburg -  Yet another innocent young life has been lost to senseless killings. Sixteen-year-old Kiernan Everts was shot dead on Tuesday night in Eldorado Park Extension 3, south of Joburg. According to the family, it is alleged that Kiernan was attending a pens down, a gathering of school-going children at the end of the year-end exams, to celebrate at Westgate Flats when the incident happened. Kiernan’s aunt Rebecca Everts told The Star that an altercation started over a hookah pipe bottle. The aunt said everybody started to run away but Kiernan, troubled by his feet, could not run fast enough. “As they were running the bullet missed one of the boys and hit Kiernan at the back of his head, killing him. I believe he could not run faster as he had a troublesome leg,” Rebecca said. It is not clear who the people involved were and who fired the shots, and why. Kiernan Lived in Fleurhof in the West Rand and was in Eldorado Park to see his uncle who had promised to take him to wild waters as a celebration for passing Grade 10. “Kiernan was supposed to be here to celebrate his passing Grade 10 with his uncle, that was the reason he was in Eldorado. When he got to Eldorado, he WhatsApped his uncle to ask him to go to Extension 3 with his friends which his uncle agreed (to) but unfortunately he did not come back alive,” Rebecca said. Kiernan was the only child and his mother Susan Everts had raised him as a single parent. The family said they would miss his smile. He was an ardent soccer follower. “Kiernan was a humble, respectful young boy, who was not outspoken but always laughing. He loved school and  wanted to finish school, he even did well in his last report,” Rebecca said. Gauteng police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo said a case of murder had been opened at Eldorado Park Police Station. “No arrest has been made yet, police are searching for the suspect.” boitumelo.metsing@inl.co.za The Star
