Johannesburg - The state of Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve in Heidelberg does not reflect the R31 million spent by the government on project upgrades at the reserve. This was uncovered by the Gauteng provincial legislature portfolio committee on economic development, environment, agriculture, rural development and infrastructure development. According to the committee’s findings, there are currently no tourist facilities at the nature reserve. “The oxidation tank services at Kareekloof Resort are not in operation as the resort is closed and non-functional, and there is an incomplete pump station.” The committee said the Gauteng Department of Agriculture and Rural Development received an allocation of R8m on infrastructure development for nature reserves and other existing infrastructure assets. The committee expressed its concerns over the number of incomplete projects at the nature reserve, despite money being allocated. The committee said the northern water supply line is complete but has not been commissioned yet owing to inadequate pressure for efficient water supply. It said that the southern waterline project completion report was released in 2018. However, the contractor failed to repair faults despite numerous warning letters. The committee also indicated that the project, which began in 2009, was still not complete. “The original budget was estimated at R8.6m and, to date, R31m has already been spent.” The committee says the Infrastructure Department would require an additional R49m to complete the project. The committee has since called on Gauteng Premier David Makhura to institute forensic investigations on Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve projects and submit a progress report by February. The Star
