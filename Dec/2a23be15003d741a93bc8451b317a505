By Khotso Kid Moleko When I think about how our parents and elders, as black people, used to despise Bantu education and how it limited black people to the great professions of teaching, police work and nursing, I become discontented. Back in the day, blacks, coloureds and Indians desired to do all that was being done by white people as professors, scientists, engineers, lawyers and artisans, including the right to vote. One can imagine the joy when, in 1994, our own black people took over the reins of power. Now the sky would be the limit, we thought. But our reality is that we have sunk lower than the racist standards that limited us then and we are fighting with black foreigners over driving trucks and serving tables. From the functional apartheid economy, under sanctions, that nonetheless ensured those despised jobs for black people, to a so-called democratic and black-led government with an open market economy in junk status. That which you despised during apartheid has become an elusive treasure. The ANC government should be skilling South Africans. Instead, it is fanning xenophobic hatred, so that they can continue to misrule this once great country. The Star
