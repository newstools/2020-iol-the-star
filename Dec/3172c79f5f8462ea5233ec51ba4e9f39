By John Whitlock I, and I’m sure many others, find it quite absurd that the family of drowned schoolboy, Enock Mpianzi, is “demanding” R20 million as compensation for his death. This exorbitant amount demanded gives one the impression it is more about feathering one’s nest rather than the grieving over the loss of a son. If this ridiculous amount is given, it would set a precedent to be followed by all those wanting to make a quick buck. Allegations, whether true or false, will become the norm. If, on the other hand, the family donates the R20m to the education department to build more schools, libraries or technical facilities, I would agree with the demand. A school could then be named after Enock. This, we all know, will not happen. The principal, as with all South African citizens, has the right to appeal his dismissal. Jacob Zuma and others have used this right for decades to avoid prosecution. Until the appeal is heard, and the decision made, he has the right to remain in his post. Orientation camps are wonderful for determining leaders. I sent my pupils to camps every year for more than 20 years without a problem. I found these camps absolutely essential. Then there is the senseless demand by the parents of Enock that Parktown Boys’ High be closed down completely. This, in a province that is lacking hundreds of new schools. Have the Mpianzis consulted with other parents on the issue? Do all parents find the school a “horrible place”? Where will all the pupils be accommodated? Schools are already overflowing. Where will the redundant teachers be placed? Why must the school be punished for the misdemeanours of a few. This is a selfish demand by his parents, with no consideration for others. Everything must revolve around them. Absolute nonsense! As with Brackenfell High, and all the other schools in the “racism” firing line, I find the motives behind it all rather sinister and somewhat malevolent. The Star
