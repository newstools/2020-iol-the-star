Johannesburg - The Star will on Friday publish a part one of a three-part investigation into the Department of Defence and Military Veterans, Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula and Defence Intelligence Chief Lieutenant General Jeremia Nyembe. The newspaper has uncovered corruption at Defence Intelligence that has cost South African taxpayers up to R4 billion. This week, The Star will reveal how an IT-cyber security company was awarded a R45 million cybersecurity training tender without following due process. The directors of that company are three Chinese men. The tender was motivated and approved in writing by Nyembe one month before it was put through the correct procurement process.
