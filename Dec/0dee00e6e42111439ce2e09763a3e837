Johannesburg - A joint government task force crushed more than 50 illegally imported second-hand vehicles this week. The government said they destroyed the cars to send a strong message that illegal activities will not tolerated by government particularity as Thursday marks International Anti-Corruption Day. SA Revenue Service (Sars) commissioner Edward Kieswetter said the proliferation of second-hand motor vehicles into the country from Europe, Asia and Africa have become a serious risk to the survival of the legitimate motor vehicle industry in the country and had negative consequences for the economy. The Inter-Agency Working Group on the Illicit Trade, which includes Sars, the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition, started crushing 57 illegally imported vehicles last month. The vehicles also pose a safety threat because they are not manufactured for the South African environment and do not go through proper safety processes like roadworthy tests. The vehicles were confiscated due to the following contraventions: Clients had produced fraudulent traveller declaration forms to use the vehicles illegally in South Africa. Some of the vehicles were driven in South Africa with a cloned vehicle registration and licence disc. The vehicles were sold without clearance and permits. Refugees in South Africa have been purchasing the vehicles and registering them in other countries. “The crushing of the … vehicles is a warning to those that continue to practice this illegal act … for unsuspecting buyers, ensure that what you are paying for is legal,” said Kieswetter.
