By Dr Thabisi Hoeane When will leaders such as Phumzile van Damme realise they are not needed in the DA as they are disturbing the party's establishment? The latest move by its leader, John Steenhuisen, to grant her a sabbatical because of her illness, is a strong indicator the DA is on her case and she is being surreptitiously pushed out. Steenhuisen argues such a sabbatical would coincide with a lull in parliamentary processes and, she would be able to rest. But this is a ridiculous argument. If there is going to be a lull in the coming months, it means necessarily, therefore, that Van Damme will not be exerting much energy and will render a sabbatical moot. The DA maintains it wants to revert to its “core values” and clearly people such as Van Damme are not part of that set-up and must go. Van Damme says she will not leave and will fight the machinations on principle. But she is just going to be politically paralysed, and the “sabbatical” move is the first shot to emasculate her.
