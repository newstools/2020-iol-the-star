By Tebogo Brown Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng made remarks about vaccines which did not sit well with heads of pharmaceutical drug companies. Mogoeng said if there be any vaccine that is of the devil, it destroys it in the name of Jesus. No vaccine is of God! Anything God did not make from creation and maintain its existence through the process of reproduction is godless. In the early 1900s, when vaccination was brought into popular use, Dr GB Shaw described it as “a peculiarly filthy piece of witchcraft”. Vaccines are toxic from their very origin. There is no safe way to manufacture one. After research on how vaccines are manufactured, M Beddow Bayly MRCS, LRCP, is quoted as having said that “it would seem to be impossible for a rational mind to conceive that a filthy virus derived from a smallpox corpse, the ulcerated udder of a cow, or the running sores of a sick horse’s heels and cultivated in scabbed festers on a calf’s abdomen could fail to have disastrous effects when inoculated into the human body …” This is how all vaccines are made and where is God in this whole process? The late African Sanusi, Credo Mutwa spoke heavily against vaccines. He said there were certain vaccines which robbed children of the ability to see spiritual entities. To preserve the ability to see spiritual entities parents used to make sure their children went through great pain. They used to heat grains of maize and, using two pieces of wood, place the corn against the skin on their shoulders. When a school inspector came to check for signs of vaccination, he would see the mark on the shoulder then assume that the child had been vaccinated. It is against the laws of nature to inject any chemical substance into a human. The body is made up of 102 minerals and a vaccine contains nothing of this kind. Why are governments so obsessed with vaccinating the whole world against a virus whose very existence is still highly questionable? The Star
