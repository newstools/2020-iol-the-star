Cape Town - Parliament is looking into how one of its officials erroneously tweeted confirmation that former President Jacob Zuma was going to attend Thursday's State of the Nation Address (SONA). Briefing the journalists, parliamentary spokesperson Moloto Mothapo said on Thursday they did not know how the official arrived at making the confirmation "It is a matter that is being dealt with internally," Mothapo said, adding that the issue was corrected on Wednesday and that it was water under the bridge when a question was asked. He also said the exercise would ensure that there was no repeat of the incident. "We will ensure internal controls are tightened," Mothapo added. On Wednesday, Parliament was forced to apologise, saying the tweet was premature and erroneously included Zuma in confirming former presidents who were to be in attendance. Zuma's lawyers had quickly issued a statement saying he would not attend SONA due to ill-health. "Our instructions remain that President Zuma is currently receiving medical treatment in a foreign country, and will therefore, not be attending the SONA,” the statement read. Even the Jacob Zuma Foundation denied that Zuma would attend Thursday’s session. “Zuma never confirmed he was going to the SONA, Parliament (is) misleading,” it said. Zuma has not attended any of Ramaphosa’s SONA events since he stepped down before the end of his term. Political Bureau
