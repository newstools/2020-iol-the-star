Cape Town - The Economic Freedom Fighters on Thursday requested that former South African president FW De Klerk leave the National Assembly where President Cyril Ramaphosa was set to deliver his State of the Nation Address. Malema rose on a point of order before President Cyril Ramaphosa's speech began and called De Klerk a "murderer" and "man with blood on his hands". "It is an insult to those who died and were tortured in Vlakplaas to have De Klerk in a democratic parliament and therefore I request that you ask De Klerk to leave," he said. "The commander of Vlakplaas, the apartheid apologist, a man with blood on his hands, has to leave parliament because he does not belong here." Speaker Thandi Modise ruled the motion out of order. But after Malema, one EFF MP after the next rose to make the same point, suggesting there was more trouble to follow from the party who vowed this week that it would not allow Ramaphosa to deliver his address. Ahead of proceedings the EFF made Gordhan the scapegoat for some of the worst crises the administration faces and threatened to disrupt SONA if Ramaphosa did not axe Gordhan. The Red Berets famously caused havoc with several of former president Jacob Zuma's state of the nation addresses, heckling him to "pay back the money" spent on refurbishing his private Nkandla home at taxpayers' expense.
