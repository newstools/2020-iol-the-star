Beijing/Tokyo - The number of people infected with the Covid-19 coronavirus has reached 44,653 in China, while Japan reported 174 cases, the largest number of infections outside China, health authorities said Wednesday. Ninety-seven deaths and 2,015 new infections were reported over a 24-hour interval in mainland China, according to the country's National Health Commission. The total death toll in China climbed to 1,113.Â Two other patients have died in the Philippines and Hong Kong. Meanwhile, Japan's health ministry confirmed 39 more people on a cruise ship off Yokohama have tested positive for Covid-19. The Diamond Princess, operated by Carnival cruises, has been quarantined for a week with thousands of passengers on board. The confirmed coronavirus patients have been removed and taken to hospital. The ministry said one quarantine officer has also been infected with the virus. The new disease was officially named Covid-19 by the World Health Organization on Tuesday, as countries continued to impose travel restrictions meant to curb the spread of the virus.     The virus broke out in December at a seafood market in Wuhan, central China, which reportedly sold exotic animals for consumption.
