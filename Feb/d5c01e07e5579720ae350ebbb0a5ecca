Thandi Tsoeu, 25, said she doesn’t think the Sona has any impact on load shedding because the country would expect that it would have stopped after the promises, hopes and dreams President Cyril Ramaphosa gave. She said her village in the Free State not only experiences load shedding, but it also has a major water crisis. “I do have access to electricity. The problem is when there is load shedding, the schedule never corresponds to where I am,” said Tsoeu, who lives in Balaclava Trust, outside Thaba Nchu. On Thursday, embattled Eskom announced that load shedding would be implemented from 9am until 6am on Saturday due to the loss of three additional units overnight which has increased the shortage in capacity, with a high probability that load shedding would continue over the weekend. “There is a possibility of increased load shedding over the next 18 months, as we are conducting critical maintenance to restore the ageing plants to good health.” Tsoeu said although her community might face these issues, she has a gas heater, which she also uses for cooking. “I also have candles and in terms of cellphone coverage, that is also a problem. When you try to call anyone in the community, you won’t get hold of them. And if we have an emergency, we can’t call the emergency services,” she said.
