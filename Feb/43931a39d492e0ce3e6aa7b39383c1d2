Cape Town - EFF leader Julius Malema insists he has never abused his wife or children. This comes after ANC MP Boy Mamabolo implied during the State of the Nation Address, that Malema had a history of abusing his wife, Mantwa Matlala-Malema. Malema was speaking at the Press Club of South Africa in Cape Town on Friday morning, a day after the EFF staged a walk out at the National Assembly following more than hour of disruptions during President Cyril Ramphosa's SONA. The EFF had been calling for former deputy president FW De Klerk to be kicked out of Parliament. Malema challenged Ramaphosa and other top political party leaders and MPs to stand up and declare that they had not beaten up a woman. He said Ramaphosa had to take the country into his confidence and assure everyone that he had never assaulted any woman. Malema also reiterated that Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan had to vacate office citing that he had collapsedÂ state-owned enterprises through political meddling. He also used the opportunity to take a swipe at Ramaphosa over Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane's report on the CR17 election campaign and his request for his bank statements to be sealed. He questioned that while NGOs had shown support for former President Jacob Zuma in court and the media had covered some of his appearances in court in drove, why where they not doing the same for the EFF. "Why is the media not in court demanding that documents be opened. These are not just documents. They are documents of the president." He added: "There is no Constitution for Ramaphosa or Zuma. We should all be subjected to one Constitution. Political Bureau
