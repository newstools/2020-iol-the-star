By Cometh Dube-Makholwa I might not be the right person to meddle in things that are politically motivated, because I have long made a decision I would never be involved in politics. The Department of Health finds itself in an unenviable position, considering the extent of corruption over the years involving MECs for health and other prominent officials. The PPE scandal is particularly damaging because it exposes health professionals, patients and the general public to the extremely dangerous virus and casts a negative image on the country globally. While the Health Department might have no issue with Dr Bandile Masuku’s professional conduct as a doctor and the performance of his duties, it might be difficult to oppose the Special Investigating Unit. Will the doctor be allowed to practise as a doctor in any health facility, regardless of the conclusion that might be drawn from the SIU report? If there is fairness, he should be employable without any question because for him to have been chosen to be a representative of the Health Department in the first place, was because he had proved himself worthy of such an honour. I wish him well. *Masuku was placed on special leave after the husband of presidency spokesperson, Khusela Diko was awarded a R125 million tender in the department. It was alleged Masuku played a pivotal role in the awarding the tender to Royal Bhaca Projects – a company 100%-owned by Thandisizwe Diko, the husband of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s spokesperson Khusela Diko. The Masukus and Dikos are family friends. Masuku’s wife Loyiso is also a business partner of Thandisizwe's. The Star
