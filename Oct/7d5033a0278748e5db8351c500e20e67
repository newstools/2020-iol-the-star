Johannesburg - A 24-year-old woman has been arrested and charged with being an accomplice to rape for allegedly tying up her niece so that her boss could rape her. According to Johannesburg Central police spokesperson, Captain Xoli Mbele, the crime took place at a tuckshop in the Joburg CBD, where the arrested woman worked. The suspected rapist fled after the incident and is still on the run. Mbele said the 15 -year-old is the daughter of the woman’s sister. He said information at their disposal was that on October 16, the teenager visited her aunt who then asked her to bring her lunch to her place of work the following day. When the teenager went there with the food as requested, she was attacked by her aunt and her employer, who suddenly appeared and closed the door of the tuckshop. “They dragged her to a back room inside the tuckshop where the aunt assisted the male suspect by tying her hands and closing her mouth with sellotape. “She undressed her and watched her boss rape her. “After they finished, they released her. She called her mother who arrived in town to pick her up and they went to the police station where a case was opened,” Mbele said. The police spokesperson said they had only managed to arrest the woman on Tuesday because she was no longer working at the tuckshop, which appeared to have new owners. It’s not yet known what the motive was for the aunt helping the man rape her niece. Mbele said investigations were underway and the woman was expected to appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s  Court. IOL
