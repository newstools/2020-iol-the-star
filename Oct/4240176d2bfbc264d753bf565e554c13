Johannesburg - The arrest of Setheo Engineering’s site foreman for allegedly defrauding the City of Joburg of millions of rand while his bosses are walking free continues to raise eyebrows. Brighton Kuzovamuhu Chifamba, a Zimbabwean national, is currently embroiled in a R126 million tender court battle against the City of Joburg. His matter is being heard at the Palm Ridge Specialised Commercial Crime Court. This comes after allegations that Setheo Engineering pocketed R66m to build a substation in Eldorado Park. The Star understands the contract was between City Power and Setheo Engineering. The city’s involvement in the matter and ongoing lawsuit against Chifamba remains a mystery. Efforts to get further clarifications from the National Prosecution Authority (NPA) proved futile. Spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane could not give clarity on how Chifamba is linked to the alleged crime. “Investigations are ongoing and more arrests are imminent,” she said. A member of the organisation and legal expert, Edwin Banda, questioned the NPA’s stance on the matter. He said it is not in dispute the city lacks any legal authority and capacity to substitute City Power as an injured party in relation to the alleged fraud. gift.tlou@inl.co.za The Star
