Johannesburg -  Three women were burnt beyond recognition and four other people died from horrific injuries when two cars collided head-on and and burst into flames in the North West province on Saturday afternoon. The incident occurred along the Ganyesa and Vryburg Road and a woman and her three month-old baby were the only survivors. However, the infant died in hospital. North West Department of Community Safety and Transport Management MEC Sello Lehari said the two vehicles were travelling in opposite directions when they collided. He said seven people died at the scene. “The vehicles burst into flames immediately after the collision, making it difficult to rescue passengers who were trapped. “Four other passengers also died at the scene of the accident bringing a total to seven; four of whom are women. A 29-year-old woman who survived with her three-month old baby girl were rushed to the hospital. “Sadly, it has been discovered that the baby passed on as they arrived at the hospital. May they rest in eternal peace. “We would like to pass our deepest condolences to the families of all the deceased and wish them strength during this difficult time. It is difficult to accept the passing of a loved one. It is even more so when the passing is as tragic as this one”, Lehari said. North West police have opened a case of culpable homicide. IOL
