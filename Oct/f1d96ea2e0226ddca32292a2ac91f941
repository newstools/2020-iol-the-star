Last month, Senzo Meyiwa would have celebrated his 33rd birthday and in five days time it will be six years since the Orlando Pirates goalkeeper was killed. While the Meyiwa family were on Tuesday afternoon unaware of any developments in the case, News24 had broken the news about police finding the firearm used to commit the crime and also that the alleged shooter had been found. Meyiwa, originally from KwaZulu-Natal, was killed while at his girlfriend Kelly Khumalo’s home in Vosloorus in an alleged robbery on October 26, 2014. Six other people were in the house at the time. According to News24, the alleged shooter is serving 30 years for the 2015 murder of Alexandra taxi boss Reggie Mohlala, who was killed with the same firearm used on Meyiwa. Meyiwa’s older brother, Sfiso, said investigators were in constant contact with them and the family had not been told about this. “And I can’t talk on something like this until we have been told by investigators if it’s true or not.” The News24 article, which quotes from reports compiled on the case for police top brass, said the investigators found the firearm at Cleveland police station after the arrest of a suspect linked to Meyiwa’s murder on July 20. It said the firearm had been taken by police when Meyiwa’s alleged shooter was arrested in 2015 for Mohlala’s murder. It revealed that the firearm was meant to be disposed of three years ago. A warning statement had also been taken from Meyiwa’s alleged killer in Johannesburg Prison. The article stated that the docket had been handed to the National Prosecuting Authority, where it was recommended that those in the house be criminally charged. “We are not commenting on the investigation into that murder case,” national police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said on Tuesday.
