Cape Town – A Johannesburg Metro Police Department officer, Rose Sithole, became a hero when she helped deliver a healthy baby boy on the streets of the CBD. The officer had received a call on the evening of September 17 that a woman appeared ready to give birth on Henry Nxumalo Street, a stone's throw from the Joburg Central police station. The call came from an integrated operations command centre camera operator, immediately sparking Sithole into action. “When officer Sithole arrived on the scene, she noticed that a 30-year-old woman, who was with her male partner, was pregnant and was, indeed, going into labour on the sidewalk. ’’She asked to borrow a blanket from the Johannesburg Central police station, but before her colleague could return with it, officer Sithole had delivered a healthy baby boy,” said JMPD spokesperson Xolani Fihla. The city's emergency management services arrived on the scene soon thereafter to take mother and baby to Coronation Clinic. Mother and son did well and were soon discharged from the clinic. The Star
