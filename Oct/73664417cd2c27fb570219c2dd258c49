By Nyaniso Qwesha Recently it was reported that ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule would be served with a warrant of arrest. It is crucial to uncover the truth and give him an opportunity to clear his name. The disservice that happened and was left unattended was frightening, when the extent of the abuse was exposed in the Free State. It affected the disadvantaged people the government is serving. Citizens were supposed to have benefited from the Estina dairy project, housing projects and the removal of asbestos. Being ethical is a crucial requirement for all of us and especially if the government places you in a position of trust. Failure to act will derail government efforts in curbing corruption. Action by the Stateâ€™s prosecuting arms assures citizens that no one is above the law and failure to act ethically and morally will catch up with you. If it is true that many people in the Free State have been wronged through various schemes, we will need to start asking ourselves serious questions about the reports by the public protector and the prosecuting authorities for their non-action or inadequate actions over all these years. It is crucial that action by the prosecuting authorities must not be influenced or seen to be affected by a sitting president. This warrant of arrest must not be pie in the sky. It needs to warn all those who were and are part of the wrongdoing, that the wheels of justice are turning. Citizens want a clean government where the main agenda is about uplifting communities, especially the vulnerable and the poor. The Star
